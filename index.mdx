{/* To contain:

- The homepage, featuring the cards currently on the homepage of https://docs.wandb.ai
- Getting started page full of pointers to good resources (new topic)
- Pointers to high-level W&B details from www such as security and pricing pages (nav entries only)
    - https://wandb.ai/site/pricing/
    - https://wandb.ai/site/security/
- Topics from https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/models/app/settings-page/ under heading **Configuring W&B**
    - Under this, bring in the secrets page from: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/secrets/
    - Also under this heading, the topics from https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/ under heading **Deployment options**

## Implementation notes

- URL rewriting is currently happening to get rid of `/core/` and `/models/` in the current site. This was necessary because of Docsy's requirement that the left-hand navigation be derived from the file structure, rather than a component like `docs.json` which composes a navigation as desired. 
- In the migrated site, there is no need to have a `core` directory, as that section is being dissolved. 
- The migrated topics in this section (i.e. topics that were originally from the Hugo site) are to be moved under `/platform/` in the file structure, from their original locations. These will require redirects.
    - `/platform/hosting/`
    - `/platform/settings/`
    - `/platform/settings/secrets/` */}

## Features

**Clone Runs with Launch**

![Run cloning interface in W&B Launch allowing hyperparameter adjustments and infrastructure selection](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/47005026/4aebe22a-70c9-4186-be74-feaf73c1b2d2)

If you want to repeat a run but tweak a couple hyperparameters--say bump the batch size to take advantage of a larger machine--it's now easy to clone a run using W&B Launch.   Go to the run overview, click Clone, and you'll be able to select new infrastructure to execute the job on, with new hyperparameters.  Learn more in the [Launch documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch).

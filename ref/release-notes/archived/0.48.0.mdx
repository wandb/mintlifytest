## Feature

* All required frontend changes for launch prioritization
  * Refer to [this blog](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/launch-releases/reports/Introducing-Priority-Based-Job-Management-with-W-B-Launch--Vmlldzo2MzE2NjI2) on how you can run more important jobs than others using Launch. 
* Refer to below changes for access control and user attribution behavior of team service accounts:
  * When a team is configured in the training environment, a service account from that team can be used to log runs in either of private or public projects within that team, and additionally attribute those runs to a user only if `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL` variable is configured in the environment and the user is part of that team.
  * When a team is not configured in the training environment and a service account is used, the runs would be logged to the named project within the service account's team, and those would be attributed to a user only if `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL` variable is configured in the environment and the user is part of that team.
  * A team service account **can not** log runs in a private project in another team, but it can log runs to public projects in other teams.

## Fixes

 * Reduce column widths for oversized runs selectors
 * Fix a couple of bugs related to Custom Roles preview feature

</Frame>

Users can now gain more control over deleting and retention of Artifacts logged with W&B, with the ability to set retention and time-to-live (TTL) policies! Determine when you want specific Artifacts to be deleted, update policies on existing Artifacts, and set TTL policies on upstream or downstream Artifacts. 

Here are the other new features include in this release: 

- Use Launch drawer when creating Sweeps 
- Delete run queue items
- Min/max aggregations nested dropdown
- Allow users to connect multiple S3-compatible buckets
- Add disk i/o system metrics 
- Use the legacy way to set permissions
- Enable CustomerSecretStore 
- Add Kubernetes as a backend for CustomerSecretStore

## Fixes
- Disable storage and artifact invoices for ongoing storage calculations refractors
- Panel deletion bug
- Remove link-version event type from project automation slider 
- Remove upper case styling for artifact type names
- Keep uncolored tags from changing color on render
- Stale defaults stuck in Launch drawer on reopen
- Trigger alias automations while creating artifact 
- Edge case failure in infinite loading tag filters

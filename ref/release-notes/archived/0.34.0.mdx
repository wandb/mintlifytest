## Features 

**********New Model Registry UI**********

<Frame>
![New Model Registry UI featuring list view, model filtering, version management, and automation controls](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/97066933/3fedbdb8-aa79-4fb6-aab8-bddd8899e8dc)
</Frame>

We’re making it easier for users to manage a long list of models, and navigate seamlessly between entities in the model registry.  With this new UI, users can:

- Look at all your registered models
- Filter to registered models within a specific team
- With the new list view, users can expand each panel to see the individual versions inside of it, including each version's aliases, and metadata or run metrics. Clicking on a version from this quick view can take you to it's version-view
- Look at an overview directly by clicking “View Details”
- See a preview of how many version, consumers, and automations are present for each registered model
- Create Automations directly
- See some metadata columns and details in preview
- Change Model Access Controls

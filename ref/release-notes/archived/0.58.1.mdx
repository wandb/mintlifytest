## Features

* W&B now supports sub-path for **Secure storage connector i.e. Bring your own bucket** capability. You can now provide a sub-path when configuring a bucket at the instance or team level. This is only available for new bucket configurations and not for existing configured buckets.
* W&B-managed storage on newer Dedicated Cloud instances in GCP & Azure will by default be encrypted with **W&B managed cloud-native keys**. This is already available on AWS instances. Each instance storage is encrypted with a key unique to the instance. Until now, all instances on GCP & Azure relied on default cloud provider-managed encryption keys.
* Makes the fields in the run config and summary copyable on click.
* If you're using W&B kubernetes operator for a customer-managed instance, you can now optionally use a custom CA for the controller manager.
* We've modified the W&B kubernetes operator to run in a non-root context by default, aligning with OpenShift's Security Context Constraints (SCCs). This change ensures smoother deployment of customer-managed instances on OpenShift by adhering to its security policies.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where exporting panels from a workspace to a report now correctly respects the panel search regex.
* Fixed an issue where setting `GORILLA_DISABLE_PERSONAL_ENTITY` to `true` was not disabling users from creating projects and writing to existing projects in their personal entities.

## Performance improvements

* We have significantly improved performance and stability for experiments with 100k+ logged points. If you've a customer-managed instance, this is available if the deployment is managed using the W&B kubernetes operator.
* Fixed issue where saving changes in large workspaces would be very slow or fail.
* Improved latency of opening workspace sections in large workspaces.

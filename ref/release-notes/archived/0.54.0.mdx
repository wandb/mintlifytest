## Features

* You can now configure Secure storage connector (BYOB) at team-level in Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed instances on Microsoft Azure. 
    * Refer to [this Terraform Module](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-azurerm-wandb/tree/main/modules/secure_storage_connector) and reach out to your W&B team for any questions.
* Organization admins can now enforce privacy settings across all W&B teams by setting those at the organization level, from within the `Settings` tab in the Organization Dashboard. 
    * W&B recommends to notify team admins and other users before making such enforcement changes.
* Enable direct lineage option for artifact lineage DAG
* It's now possible to restrict Organization or Instance Admins from self-joining or adding themselves to a W&B team, thus ensuring that only Data & AI personas have access to the projects within the teams. 
    * W&B advises to exercise caution and understand all implications before enabling this setting. Reach out to your W&B team for any questions.
* Dedicated Cloud on AWS is now also available in the Seoul (S. Korea) region.

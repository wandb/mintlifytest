Enable a seamless model CI/CD workflow using Webhook Automations to trigger specific actions within the CI/CD pipeline when certain events occur. Use webhooks to facilitate a clean hand-off point between ML engineering and devops. To see this in practice for [Model Evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j-Mtbo-E74) and [Model Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5UiAFjM2nA), check out the linked demo videos. Learn more in [our docs](/guides/core/automations/create-automations/webhook).

## Features

**Revamped Organization Dashboard**

We've made it easier to see who's making the most W&B with our overhauled Organization Dashboard, accessible to W&B admins.  You can now see details on who's created runs and reports,  who's actively using W&B, who's invites are pending--and you can export all this in CSV to share across your organization.  Learn more about [access management](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/access-management-intro/).

For Dedicated Cloud customers, this feature has been turned on.  For Customer-Managed W&B customers, contact W&B support and we'll be happy to work with you to enable it.

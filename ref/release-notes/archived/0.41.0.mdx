Weâ€™ve updated the Launch homepage, so users looking to get started with Launch will have a much easier way to get setup quickly. Easily access detailed documentation, or simply follow the three Quickstart steps to create a Launch queue, agent, and start launching jobs immediately. 

Here are the other new features included in this release: 

- Add new reverse proxy to track OpenAI requests and responses
- Show agent version on agent overview page
- New model registry workflow removed from feature flag for all users

## Fixes

- Empty projects causing infinite load on storage explorer
- Runs marked failed when run queue items are failed
- Use correct bucket for storing OpenAI proxy artifacts
- SEO tags not properly rendered by host
- Trigger export in background, on context deadline as well
- Transition runs in pending state to running when run is initialized
- Query so Launch queues show most recent completed and failed jobs

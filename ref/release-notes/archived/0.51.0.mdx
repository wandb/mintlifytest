## Features

**You can now save multiple views of any workspace by clicking "Save as a new view" in the overflow menu of the workspace bar.**

See [Saved workspace views](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/pages/workspaces#create-saved-workspace-views) to learn more.

The release also includes these capabilities:
* You can now [set a project's visibility scope to Restricted](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/restricted-projects/) if you want to collaborate on AI workflows related to sensitive or confidential data. 
    * When you create a **restricted project** within a team, you can add specific members from the team. Unlike other project visibility scopes, all members of a team do not get implicit access to a restricted project.
* **Enhanced Run Overview page performance**: now 91% faster on load, with search functionality improved by 99.9%. Also enjoy RegEx search for Config and Summary data. 
* **New UX for Artifacts Lineage DAG** introduces clustering for 5+ nodes at the same level, preview window to examine a node's details, and a significant speedup in the graph's loading time.
* The template variable values used for a run executed by launch, for example GPU type and quantity, are now shown on the queue's list of runs.  This makes it  easier to see which runs are requesting which resources.
* Cloning a run with Launch now pre-selects the overrides, queue, and template variable values used by the cloned run.
* Instance admins will now see a `Teams` tab in the organization dashboard. It can be used to join a specific team when needed, whether it's to monitor the team activity as per organizational guidelines or to help the team when team admins are not available. 
* SCIM User API now returns the `groups` attribute as part of the GET endpoint, which includes the id of the groups / teams a user is part of.
* All Dedicated Cloud instances on GCP are now managed using the new [W&B Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/operator/). With that, the new Parquet Store service is also available. 
    * Parquet store allows performant & cost efficient storage of run history data in parquet format in the blob storage. Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS & Azure are already managed using the operator and include the parquet store.
* Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS have been updated to use the latest version of the relational data storage, and the compute infrastructure has been upgraded to a newer generation with better performance.

> **Advanced Notice**: We urge all customers who use Webhooks with Automations to add a valid A-record for their endpoints as we are going to disallow using IP address based Webhook URLs from the next release onwards. This is being done to protect against SSRF vulnerability and other related threat vectors.

## Fixes

* Fixed issue where expressions tab was not rendering for line plots.
* Use display name for sweeps when grouped by sweeps in charts and runs table.
* Auto navigation to runs page when selecting job version.

## Features

**Metric visualization enhancements** 

<Frame>
![Enhanced metric visualization interface supporting up to 100 metrics with time-weighted exponential moving averages](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/47005026/1bb0b16c-eaae-4348-be0d-cc788b67853e)
</Frame>


We're continuing to enhance our core metric visualization experience.   You can now define which metrics from regular expressions to render in your plots, up to 100 metrics at once.   And to more accurately represent data at high scale, we've add a new time-weighted exponential moving average smoothing algorithm for plots ([check out all of our supported algorithms](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/features/panels/line-plot/smoothing#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)).

**Feedback surveys**

W&B has always built our product based on customer feedback.  Now, we're happy to introduce a new way for you to shape the future of W&B: in-app feedback surveys in your Dedicated Cloud or Customer-Managed W&B install.   Starting July 17th, W&B users will start periodically seeing simple 1 - 10 Net Promoter Score surveys in the application.   All identifying information is anonymized.   We appreciate all your feedback and look forward to making W&B even better, together.

## Fixes

* Major improvement to artifact download speed: over a 6x speedup on our 1-million-file artifact benchmark.  Please upgrade to SDK version 0.15.5+.  
* (Launch) Optuna is now available as [a sweeps scheduler with Sweeps on Launch](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch/sweeps-on-launch#create-a-custom-sweep-scheduler), allowing more efficient exploration of hyperparameters.
* Run data permadeletion is now available (default off).  This can be enabled with the GORILLA_DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD environment variable, specified in hours.  Please take care before updating this variable and/or chat with W&B Support, since the deletion is permanent.  Artifacts will not be deleted by this setting.  
* Updated report sharing emails to include a preview.
* Relaxed HTML sanitation rules for reports in projects; this had been causing rare problems with report rendering.
* Expanded the maximum number of metrics that can be matched by a regex in chart configuration; previously this had been always 10, the maximum is now 100.
* Fixed issue with media panel step slider becoming unsynced with the media shown.
* Added time-weighted exponential moving average as an option for smoothing in plots.
* The "Search panels" textbox in workspaces now preserves the user's last search.
* Applying a username filter when runs are grouped will no longer error.
* (Launch) The loading of the Launch tab should now be much faster, typically under two seconds.
* (Launch) There’s now an option to edit queue configs using YAML instead of JSON.  It’s also now more clear how to edit queue configs.
* (Launch) Runs will now show error messages in the UI when they crash or fail.
* (Launch) If you don’t specify a project when creating a job, we’ll now use the value for WANDB_PROJECT from your wandb.init.
* (Launch) Updated support for custom accelerator images—these will run in noninteractive mode when building, which had been blocking some images.
* (Launch) Fixed issue where the run author for sweeps was the agent service account, rather than the real author
* (Launch) Clicking outside the Launch drawer will no longer close the drawer automatically.
* (Launch) Fixed issue where training jobs that had been enqueued by a sweep but not run yet were not correctly removed from the queue if you later stopped the sweep.
* (Launch) The Launch navigation link is now hidden for users who aren't part of the team.
* (Launch) Fixed formatting and display issues on Agent logs.
* Fixed scrolling, resizing, and cloning issues in Automations panel.
* Fixed pagination on artifact action history.
* Added support for pre-signed URLs using a VPC endpoint URL if the AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL env var is set and passed in from the SDK side.
* Fixed enterprise dashboard link when organization name contains "&"
* Updated tag colors to be consistent

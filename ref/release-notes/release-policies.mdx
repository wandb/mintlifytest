This page gives details about W&B Server releases and W&B's release policies. This page relates to [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) and [Self-Managed](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/) deployments. To learn more about an individual W&B Server release, refer to [W&B release notes](/ref/release-notes/).

W&B fully manages [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud) and the details in this page do not apply.

## Release support and end of life policy
W&B supports a major W&B Server release for 12 months from its initial release date.
- **Dedicated Cloud** instances are automatically updated to maintain support.
- Customers with **Self-managed** instances are responsible for upgrading in time to maintain support. Avoid staying on an unsupported version.

  <Note>
  W&B strongly recommends customers with **Self-managed** instances to update their deployments with the latest release at minimum once per quarter to maintain support and receive the latest features, performance improvements, and fixes.
  </Note>

## Release types and frequencies
- **Major releases** are produced monthly, and may include new features, enhancements, performance improvements, medium and low severity bug fixes, and deprecations. An example of a major release is `0.68.0`.
- **Patch releases** within a major version are produced as needed, and include critical and high severity bug fixes. An example of a patch release is `0.67.1`.

## Release rollout
1. After testing and validation are complete, a release is first rolled out to all **Dedicated Cloud** instances to keep them fully updated.
1. After additional observation, the release is published, and **Self-managed** deployments can upgrade to it on their own schedule, and are responsible for upgrading in time to comply with the [Release support and End of Life (EOL) policy](#release-support-and-end-of-life-policy). Learn more about [upgrading W&B Server](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/server-upgrade-process).

## Downtime during upgrades
- When a **Dedicated Cloud** instance is upgraded, downtime is generally not expected, but may occur in certain situations:
  - If a new feature or enhancement requires changes to the underlying infrastructure, such as compute, storage or network.
  - To roll out a critical infrastructure change such as a security fix.
  - If the instance's current version has reached its [End of Life (EOL)](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/server-upgrade-process) and is upgraded by W&B to maintain support.
- For **Self-managed** deployments, the customer is responsible for implementing a rolling update process that meets their service level objectives (SLOs), such as by [running W&B Server on Kubernetes](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/kubernetes-operator/).

## Feature availability
After installing or upgrading, certain features may not be immediately available.

### Enterprise features
An Enterprise license includes support for important security capabilities and other enterprise-friendly functionality. Some advanced features require an Enterprise license.

- **Dedicated Cloud** includes an Enterprise license and no action is required.
- On **Self-managed** deployments, features that require an Enterprise license are not available until it is set. To learn more or obtain an Enterprise license, refer to [Obtain your W&B Server license](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed.md#obtain-your-wb-server-license).

### Private preview and opt-in features
Most features are available immediately after installing or upgrading W&B Server. The W&B team must enable certain features before you can use them in your instance.

<Warning>
Any feature in a preview phase is subject to change. A preview feature is not guaranteed to become generally available.
</Warning>

- **Private preview**: W&B invites design partners and early adopters to test these features and provide feedback. Private preview features are not recommended for production environments.

    The W&B team must enable a private preview feature for your instance before you can use it. Public documentation is not available; instructions are provided directly. Interfaces and APIs may change, and the feature may not be fully implemented.
- **Public preview**: Contact W&B to opt in to a public preview to try it out before it is generally available.

    The W&B team must enable a public preview feature before you can use it in your instance. Documentation may not be complete, interfaces and APIs may change, and the feature may not be fully implemented.

W&B v0.73 marks a significant milestone in the migration to W&B Registry from team-level Model Registry; most organizations will be migrated automatically during the upgrade. UI improvements include colorblind-safe run color palettes, continuous color options metric-based run coloring, and smoother panel reorganization. This release also provides service principal authentication for BYOB (Bring Your Own Bucket) setups with CoreWeave AI Object Storage, along with improved console log handling and additional enhancements.

The latest patch is **v0.73.1**. Refer to [Patches](#patches).

## Upcoming changes
- In an upcoming release, we will align multi-run and single-run workspace views, so when you drill into a single run, you'll see the same layout and configuration of panels as you've configured for the multi-run view, including any custom charts, layouts, and settings. The goal is help you stay in context and avoid re-work around configuring your views. However, this will remove the ability to customize unique single-run views, isolated from the rest of the workspace. Reach out to your W&B team or [support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) for any questions about the migration.
- Over the next several releases, we will continue migrating existing team-level Model Registry to W&B Registry. For details and a reminder about the timeline, see the [W&B Registry GA announcement](#registry_ga_announcement) below.

## Known issues
In v0.73.0, resizing or reordering workspace panels may not be reflected in saved views. This bug is fixed in v0.73.1. If you experience this issue, upgrade to v0.73.1, which includes the fix. If you can't upgrade, contact [support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) for a workaround.

## Features
- <a id="registry_ga_announcement"></a>We're migrating existing team-level Model Registry to W&B Registry in stages over the next several releases. **No action is needed on your end; W&B will automatically copy Model Registry assets for each team to a corresponding automatically-created team-level private registry.** Existing references to model collections in your old team-level Model Registry will still work.
    1. Server v0.73 (this release) includes an opt-out environment variable that will migrate the team's Model Registry automatically during the upgrade. Migration takes between 5 and 30 minutes for most organizations. During the migration, linking artifacts to either the old Model Registry or the new Registry will fail with an error. **Artifact logging and retrieval will not be affected**.
    2. In Server v0.74 (end of September), we will remove the opt-out flag and migration will happen during the upgrade.

    We're optimizing for a seamless upgrade to a powerful new experience. Contact your W&B account team or [support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) if you have any questions about the migration.
- Added a copy button to the [Run Logs console page](/guides/app/console-logs/) and improved paste behavior.
- W&B now offers two new colorblind-safe color palettes for runs. Set these in the **Runs** section of the [Workspace settings](/guides/app/features/cascade-settings/#workspace-settings).
- When [coloring runs by metrics or numeric configs](/guides/runs/color-code-runs/), you can now choose from five new continuous color palettes.
- During a [W&B run](/guides/runs/), [CoreWeave Mission Control](https://www.coreweave.com/mission-control) monitors your compute infrastructure. This integration is now available on Dedicated Cloud.
- BYOB with CoreWeave AI Object Storage now supports authentication with service principals in Multi-tenant Cloud, Dedicated Cloud, and Self-Managed deployments. This helps you to avoid using static credentials in your deployment. Learn more at [Bring your own bucket (BYOB)](/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector/).

### Weave
- You can now group sessions or conversations across multiple traces with [Weave Threads](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/threads/).
- The **Trace view**'s new [Graph view](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree#graph-view) visualizes the call tree structure as a graph.
- The **Trace view** includes new specialized views for [documents](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/core-types/media#documents) retrieved with ChromaDB and Langchain improves handling of schemas such as chats. In **Trace view**, click a document to open its detailed view in a drawer to the right. Learn more at [Navigate the trace view](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree/).
- You can now attach [HTML](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/core-types/media#html) to a trace as a media type.
- From the **Assets** tab, you can now create and edit prompts. Click **Assets**, then in the navigation, click **Prompts**. Click **New prompt** or click the name of an existing prompt to view its details. From there, click the pencil icon to edit and republish the prompt.

## Fixes

- Improved the smoothness and accuracy of [dragging and dropping panels](/guides/app/features/panels/#move-a-panel) within a section and between sections.
- In [full screen panel view](/guides/app/features/panels/#view-a-panel-in-full-screen-mode), the **Esc** key now returns you to the workspace.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a panel in a workspace to zoom unexpectedly after returning from full screen.
- In [plot settings](/guides/app/features/panels/line-plot/#edit-line-plot-settings), chart and legend settings have been consolidated to a single tab.
- Fixed a bug where panel legends were ordered incorrectly after polling updates.
- Improved the formatting of panels with long exponential Y-axis values and those with a large number of significant digits.
- [Overlays for panels](/guides/app/features/panels/media/#overlays) without matching runs are now hidden.
- Fixed a bug where clicking on a run's tag in a workspace's **Runs** tab or **Runs** list did not filter by the tag.
- Fixed a bug that could allow a user to bypass the max runs limit.
- When you toggle runs on or off, W&B no longer reloads the media for other runs in the panel.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a report to crash when expanding or collapsing a section after pressing **Tab**.
- Fixed a bug on mobile displays where scrolling could cause logged videos to automatically play in full screen.

## Other changes
- The custom grid layout was removed from W&B Workspaces with Server release v0.73.0. Previously, custom grid layout allowed you to adjust the size of individual panels within a section. Now, resizing a panel in a workspace section resizes all panels in that section, whether you configure the workspace using the [W&B App](/guides/app/features/panels/#manage-a-sections-panels) or the [Workspace API](ref/wandb_workspaces/workspaces#class-sectionlayoutsettings). Custom grid layout remains available in [W&B Reports](/guides/reports/) and the [Reports API](/ref/wandb_workspaces/reports).

The release includes the following additional updates:

* W&B Models now seamlessly integrates with **_Azure public cloud_**. You could now create a Dedicated Cloud instance in an Azure region directly from your Azure subscription and manage it as an Azure ISV resource. [This integration is in private preview](https://wandb.ai/site/partners/azure).
* Enable automations at the Registry level to monitor changes and events across all collections in the registry and trigger actions accordingly. This eliminates the need to configure separate webhooks and automations for individual collections.{/* more */}
* Ability to assign x_label, e.g. node-0, in run settings object to distinguish logs and metrics by label, e.g. node, in distributed runs. Enables grouping system metrics and console logs by label for visualization in the workspace.
* **_Coming soon_** with a patch release this week, you will be able to use organization-level service accounts to automate your W&B workloads across all teams in your instance. You would still be able to use existing team-level service accounts if you would like more control over the access scope of a service account.
    * Allow org-level service accounts to interact with Registry. Such service accounts can be invited to a registry using the invite modal and are displayed in the members table along with respective organization roles.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where users creating custom roles including the `Create Artifact` permission were not able to log artifacts to a project.
* Fixed the issue with metadata logging for files in instances that have subpath support configured for BYOB.
* Block webhook deletion if used by organization registry automations.

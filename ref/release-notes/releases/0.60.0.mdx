## Features

* Final updates for 1.1.1 Compliance of Level AA 2.2 for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards.
* W&B can now disable auto-version-upgrade for customer-managed instances using the W&B kubernetes operator. You can request this to your W&B team.
    * Note that W&B requires all instances to upgrade periodically to comply with the 6-month end-of-life period for each version. W&B does not support versions older than 6 months.

<Note>

</Note>

## Fixes

* Fixed a bug to allow instance admins on Dedicated Cloud and Customer-managed instances to access workspaces in personal entities.
* SCIM Groups and Users GET endpoints now filter out service accounts from the responses. Only non service account users are now returned by those endpoints.
* Fixed a user management bug by removing the ability of team admins to simultaneously delete a user from the overall instance while deleting them from a team. Instance or Org admins are responsible to delete a user from the overall instance / organization.

## Performance improvements

* Reduced the latency when adding a panel by up to 90% in workspaces with many metrics.
* Improved the reliability and performance of parquet exports to blob storage when runs are resumed often. 
    * Runs export to blob storage in parquet format is available on Dedicated Cloud and on Customer-managed instances that are enabled using the W&B kubernetes operator.

## Feature

* Add panel bank setting to auto-expand search results
* Better visibility for run queue item issues
* Dedicated Cloud customers on AWS can now use Privatelink to securely connect to their deployments. 
    * The feature is in private preview and will be part of an advanced pricing tier at GA. Reach out to your W&B team if interested.
* You can now automate user role assignment for organization or team scopes using the [SCIM role assignment API](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/scim/#assign-organization-level-role-to-user)
* All Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS & Azure are now managed using the new W&B Kubernetes Operator. With that, the new Parquet Store service is also available. The service allows for performant & cost efficient storage of run history data in parquet format in the blob storage. That in turn leads to faster loading of relevant history data in charts & plots that are used to evaluate the runs.
* W&B Kubernetes Operator and along with that the Parquet Store service are now available for use in customer-managed instances. We encourage customers that already use Kubernetes to host W&B, to reach out to their W&B team on how they can use the operator. And we highly recommend others to migrate to Kubernetes in order to receive the latest performance improvements and new services in future via operator. We're happy to assist with planning such a migration.

## Fixes

* Properly pass template variables through sweep scheduler
* Scheduler polluting sweep yaml generator
* Display user roles correctly on team members page when search or sort is applied
* Org admins can again delete personal projects in their Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed server instance
* Add validation for SCIM GET groups API for pending users

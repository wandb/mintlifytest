## Features

* You can now enforce username and full name for users in your organization, by using OIDC claims from your SSO provider. Reach out to your W&B team or support if interested.
* You can now disable use of personal projects in your organization to ensure that all projects are created within W&B teams and governed using admin-enforced guidelines. Reach out to your W&B team or support if interested.
* Option to expand all versions in a cluster of runs or artifacts in the Artifacts Lineage DAG view.
* UI improvements to Artifacts Lineage DAG - the type will now be visible for each entry in a cluster.

## Fixes

* Added pagination to image panels in media banks, displaying up to 32 images per page with enhanced grid aesthetics and improved pagination controls, while introducing a workaround for potential offset inconsistencies.
* Resolved an issue where tooltips on system charts were not displaying by enforcing the `isHovered` parameter, which is essential for the crosshair UI visibility.
* Unset the max-width property for images within media panels, addressing unintended style constraints previously applied to all images.
* Fixed broken config overrides in launch drawer.
* Fixed Launch drawer's behavior when cloning from a run.

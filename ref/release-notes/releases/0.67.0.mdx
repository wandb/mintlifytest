## Features

- In Reports, you can now give a run a custom display name per panel grid. This allows you to replace the run’s (often long and opaque) training-time name with one that is more meaningful to your audience. The report updates the name in all panel grids, helping you to explain your hard-won experimental insights to your colleagues in a concise and readable way. The original run name remain intact in the project, so doing this won’t disrupt your collaborators.
- When you expand a panel in the workspace, it now opens in full screen mode with more space. In this view, line plots now render with more granular detail, using up 10,000 bins. The run selector appear next to the panel, letting you easily toggle, group, or filter runs in context.
- From any panel, you can now copy a unique URL that links directly to that panel's full screen view. This makes it even easier to share a link to dig into interesting or pathological patterns in your plots.
- Run Comparer is a powerful tool you can use to compare the configurations and key metrics of important runs alongside their loss curves. Run Comparer has been updated:
    - Faster to add a Run Comparer panel, as an expanded option in **Add Panels**.
    - By default, a Run Comparer panel takes up more space, so you can see the values right away.
    - Improved readability and legibility of a Run Comparer panel. You can use new controls to quickly change row and column sizes so you can read long or nested values.
    - You can copy any value in the panel to your clipboard with a single click.
    - You can search keys with regular expressions to quickly find exactly the subset of metrics you want to compare across. Your search history is saved to help you iterate efficiently between views.
    - Run Comparer is now more reliable at scale, and handles larger workspaces more efficiently, reducing the likelihood of poor performance or a crashed panel.{/* more */}
- Segmentation mask controls have been updated:
    - You can now toggle each mask type on or off in bulk, or toggle all masks or all images on or off.
    - You can now change each class’s assigned color, helping to avoid confusion if multiple classes use the same color.
- When you open a media panel in full screen mode, you can now use the left or right arrows on your keyboard to step through the images, *without* first clicking on the step slider.
- Media panels now color run names, matching the run selector. This makes it easier to associate a run’s media values with related metrics and plots.
- In the run selector, you can now filter by whether a run has certain media key or not.
- You can now move runs between groups in the W&B App UI, and you can create new groups after the run is logged.
- Automations can now be edited in the UI
- An automation can now notify a Slack channel for artifact events. When creating an automation, select “Slack notification” for the Action type.
- Registry now supports global search by default, allowing you to search across all registries by registry name, collection name, alias, or tag.
- In Tables and Query panels that use the `runs` expression, you can use the new Runs History step slider and drop-down controls to view a table of metrics at each step of a run.
- Playground in W&B Weave supports new models: OpenAI's `gpt-4.5-preview`  and Deepseek's `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner`.
- Weave tracing has two new agent framework integrations: CrewAI and OpenAI’s Agent SDK.
- In the Weave UI, you can now build Datasets from traces. Learn more: https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/core-types/datasets#create-edit-and-delete-a-dataset-in-the-ui
- The Weave Python SDK now provides a way to filter the inputs and outputs of your Weave data to ensure sensitive data does not leave your network perimeter. You can configure to redact sensitive data. Learn more: https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/redact-pii/
- To streamline your experience, the System tab in the individual run workspace view will be removed in an upcoming release. View full information about system metrics in the System section of the workspace. For questions, contact [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com).

## Security

- `golang crypto` has been upgraded to v0.36.0.
- `golang oauth2` has been upgraded to v0.28.0.
- In Weave, `pyarrow` is now pinned to v17.0.0.

## Performance

- Frontend updates significantly reduce workspace reload times by storing essential data in the browser cache across visits. The update optimizes loading of saved views, metric names, the run selector, run counts, W&B’s configuration details, and the recomputation of workspace views.
- Registry overview pages now load significantly faster.
- Improved the performance of selecting metrics for the X, Y, or Z values in a scatter plot in a workspace with thousands of runs or hundreds of metrics.
- Performance improvements to Weave evaluation logging.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug in Reports where following a link to a section in the report would not open to that section.
- Improved the behavior of how Gaussian smoothing handles index reflection, matching SciPy's default "reflect" mode.
- A Report comment link sent via email now opens directly to the comment.
- Fixed a bug that could crash a workspace if a sweep takes longer than 2 billion compute seconds by changing the variable type for sweep compute seconds to `int64` rather than `int32`.
- Fixed display bugs that could occur when a report included multiple run sets.
- Fixed a bug where panels Quick Added to an alphabetically sorted section were sorted incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug that generated malformed user invitation links.

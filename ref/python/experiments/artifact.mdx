## <kbd>class</kbd> `Artifact`
Flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning. 

Construct an empty W&B Artifact. Populate an artifacts contents with methods that begin with `add`. Once the artifact has all the desired files, you can call `run.log_artifact()` to log it.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.__init__`

```python
__init__(
    name: 'str',
    type: 'str',
    description: 'str | None' = None,
    metadata: 'dict[str, Any] | None' = None,
    incremental: 'bool' = False,
    use_as: 'str | None' = None
) â†’ None
```

**Args:**
 
 - `name` (str):  A human-readable name for the artifact. Use the name to identify  a specific artifact in the W&B App UI or programmatically. You can  interactively reference an artifact with the `use_artifact` Public API.  A name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots.  The name must be unique across a project. 
 - `type` (str):  The artifact's type. Use the type of an artifact to both organize  and differentiate artifacts. You can use any string that contains letters,  numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. Common types include `dataset` or `model`.  Include `model` within your type string if you want to link the artifact  to the W&B Model Registry. Note that some types reserved for internal use  and cannot be set by users. Such types include `job` and types that start with `wandb-`. 
 - `description (str | None) = None`:  A description of the artifact. For Model or Dataset Artifacts,  add documentation for your standardized team model or dataset card. View  an artifact's description programmatically with the `Artifact.description`  attribute or programmatically with the W&B App UI. W&B renders the  description as markdown in the W&B App. 
 - `metadata (dict[str, Any] | None) = None`:  Additional information about an artifact. Specify metadata as a  dictionary of key-value pairs. You can specify no more than 100 total keys. 
 - `incremental`:  Use `Artifact.new_draft()` method instead to modify an  existing artifact. 
 - `use_as`:  Deprecated. 
 - `is_link`:  Boolean indication of if the artifact is a linked artifact(`True`) or source artifact(`False`). 



**Returns:**
 An `Artifact` object. 







---

### <kbd>property</kbd> Artifact.aliases

List of one or more semantically-friendly references or 

identifying "nicknames" assigned to an artifact version. 

Aliases are mutable references that you can programmatically reference. Change an artifact's alias with the W&B App UI or programmatically. See [Create new artifact versions](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/create-a-new-artifact-version) for more information.

 - `name`:  The path within the artifact to add the object. 
 - `overwrite`:  If True, overwrite existing objects with the same file  path if applicable. 



**Returns:**
 The added manifest entry 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactFinalizedError`:  You cannot make changes to the current artifact version because it is finalized. Log a new artifact version instead. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.add_dir`

```python

    policy: "Literal['mutable', 'immutable'] | None" = 'mutable',
    merge: 'bool' = False
) â†’ None
```

Add a local directory to the artifact. 



**Args:**
 
 - `local_path`:  The path of the local directory. 
 - `name`:  The subdirectory name within an artifact. The name you  specify appears in the W&B App UI nested by artifact's `type`.  Defaults to the root of the artifact. 
 - `skip_cache`:  If set to `True`, W&B will not copy/move files to  the cache while uploading 
 - `policy`:  By default, "mutable". 
    - mutable: Create a temporary copy of the file to prevent corruption during upload. 
    - immutable: Disable protection, rely on the user not to delete or change the file. 
 - `merge`:  If `False` (default), throws ValueError if a file was already added in a previous add_dir call  and its content has changed. If `True`, overwrites existing files with changed content.  Always adds new files and never removes files. To replace an entire directory, pass a name when adding the directory  using `add_dir(local_path, name=my_prefix)` and call `remove(my_prefix)` to remove the directory, then add it again. 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactFinalizedError`:  You cannot make changes to the current  artifact version because it is finalized. Log a new artifact  version instead. 
 - `ValueError`:  Policy must be "mutable" or "immutable"

    policy: "Literal['mutable', 'immutable'] | None" = 'mutable',
    overwrite: 'bool' = False
) â†’ ArtifactManifestEntry
```

Add a local file to the artifact. 



**Args:**
 
 - `local_path`:  The path to the file being added. 
 - `name`:  The path within the artifact to use for the file being added.  Defaults to the basename of the file. 
 - `is_tmp`:  If true, then the file is renamed deterministically to avoid  collisions. 
 - `skip_cache`:  If `True`, do not copy files to the cache  after uploading. 
 - `policy`:  By default, set to "mutable". If set to "mutable",  create a temporary copy of the file to prevent corruption  during upload. If set to "immutable", disable  protection and rely on the user not to delete or change the  file. 
 - `overwrite`:  If `True`, overwrite the file if it already exists. 



**Returns:**
 The added manifest entry. 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactFinalizedError`:  You cannot make changes to the current  artifact version because it is finalized. Log a new artifact  version instead. 
 - `ValueError`:  Policy must be "mutable" or "immutable" 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.add_reference`

```python
add_reference(
    uri: 'ArtifactManifestEntry | str',
    name: 'StrPath | None' = None,
    checksum: 'bool' = True,
    max_objects: 'int | None' = None
) â†’ Sequence[ArtifactManifestEntry]
```

Add a reference denoted by a URI to the artifact. 

Unlike files or directories that you add to an artifact, references are not uploaded to W&B. For more information, see [Track external files](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/track-external-files). 

By default, the following schemes are supported: 


- http(s): The size and digest of the file will be inferred by the  `Content-Length` and the `ETag` response headers returned by the server. 
- s3: The checksum and size are pulled from the object metadata.  If bucket versioning is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked. 
- gs: The checksum and size are pulled from the object metadata. If bucket  versioning is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked. 
- https, domain matching `*.blob.core.windows.net` 
- Azure: The checksum and size are be pulled from the blob metadata.  If storage account versioning is enabled, then the version ID is  also tracked. 
- file: The checksum and size are pulled from the file system. This scheme  is useful if you have an NFS share or other externally mounted volume  containing files you wish to track but not necessarily upload. 

For any other scheme, the digest is just a hash of the URI and the size is left blank. 



**Args:**
 
 - `uri`:  The URI path of the reference to add. The URI path can be an object  returned from `Artifact.get_entry` to store a reference to another  artifact's entry. 
 - `name`:  The path within the artifact to place the contents of this reference. 
 - `checksum`:  Whether or not to checksum the resource(s) located at the  reference URI. Checksumming is strongly recommended as it enables  automatic integrity validation. Disabling checksumming will speed up  artifact creation but reference directories will not iterated through so the  objects in the directory will not be saved to the artifact. We recommend  setting `checksum=False` when adding reference objects, in which case  a new version will only be created if the reference URI changes. 
 - `max_objects`:  The maximum number of objects to consider when adding a  reference that points to directory or bucket store prefix.  By default, the maximum number of objects allowed for Amazon S3,  GCS, Azure, and local files is 10,000,000. Other URI schemas  do not have a maximum. 



**Returns:**
 The added manifest entries. 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactFinalizedError`:  You cannot make changes to the current artifact version because it is finalized. Log a new artifact version instead. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.checkout`

```python
checkout(root: 'str | None' = None) â†’ str

 - `root`:  The directory to replace with this artifact's files. 



**Returns:**
 The path of the checked out contents. 



**Raises:**

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.delete`

```python
delete(delete_aliases: 'bool' = False) â†’ None
```

Delete an artifact and its files. 

If called on a linked artifact, only the link is deleted, and the source artifact is unaffected. 

Use `artifact.unlink()` instead of `artifact.delete()` to remove a link between a source artifact and a linked artifact. 



**Args:**
 
 - `delete_aliases`:  If set to `True`, deletes all aliases associated  with the artifact. Otherwise, this raises an exception if  the artifact has existing aliases. This parameter is ignored  if the artifact is linked (a member of a portfolio collection). 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactNotLoggedError`:  If the artifact is not logged. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.download`

```python
download(

    skip_cache: 'bool | None' = None,
    path_prefix: 'StrPath | None' = None,
    multipart: 'bool | None' = None
) â†’ FilePathStr
```

Download the contents of the artifact to the specified root directory. 

Existing files located within `root` are not modified. Explicitly delete `root` before you call `download` if you want the contents of `root` to exactly match the artifact. 



**Args:**
 
 - `root`:  The directory W&B stores the artifact's files. 
 - `allow_missing_references`:  If set to `True`, any invalid reference paths  will be ignored while downloading referenced files. 
 - `skip_cache`:  If set to `True`, the artifact cache will be skipped when  downloading and W&B will download each file into the default root or  specified download directory. 
 - `path_prefix`:  If specified, only files with a path that starts with the given  prefix will be downloaded. Uses unix format (forward slashes). 
 - `multipart`:  If set to `None` (default), the artifact will be downloaded  in parallel using multipart download if individual file size is greater than  2GB. If set to `True` or `False`, the artifact will be downloaded in  parallel or serially regardless of the file size. 



**Returns:**
 The path to the downloaded contents. 



**Raises:**
 
 - `ArtifactNotLoggedError`:  If the artifact is not logged. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.file`

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Artifact.finalize`

```python
finalize() â†’ None
```

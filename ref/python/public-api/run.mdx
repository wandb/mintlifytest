---

### <kbd>property</kbd> Run.username

This API is deprecated. Use `entity` instead. 



---

### <kbd>classmethod</kbd> `Run.create`

```python
create(
    api: 'public.Api',
    run_id: 'str | None' = None,
    project: 'str | None' = None,
    entity: 'str | None' = None,
    state: "Literal['running', 'pending']" = 'running'
)
```

Create a run for the given project. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.delete`

```python
delete(delete_artifacts=False)
```

Delete the given run from the wandb backend. 



**Args:**
 
 - `delete_artifacts` (bool, optional):  Whether to delete the artifacts  associated with the run. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.file`

```python
file(name)
```

Return the path of a file with a given name in the artifact. 



**Args:**
 
 - `name` (str):  name of requested file. 



**Returns:**
 A `File` matching the name argument. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.files`

```python
files(
    names: 'list[str] | None' = None,
    pattern: 'str | None' = None,
    per_page: 'int' = 50
)
```

Returns a `Files` object for all files in the run which match the given criteria. 

You can specify a list of exact file names to match, or a pattern to match against. If both are provided, the pattern will be ignored. 



**Args:**
 
 - `names` (list):  names of the requested files, if empty returns all files 
 - `pattern` (str, optional):  Pattern to match when returning files from W&B.  This pattern uses mySQL's LIKE syntax,  so matching all files that end with .json would be "%.json".  If both names and pattern are provided, a ValueError will be raised. 
 - `per_page` (int):  number of results per page. 



**Returns:**
 A `Files` object, which is an iterator over `File` objects. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.history`

```python
history(samples=500, keys=None, x_axis='_step', pandas=True, stream='default')
```

Return sampled history metrics for a run. 

This is simpler and faster if you are ok with the history records being sampled. 



**Args:**
 
 - `samples `:  (int, optional) The number of samples to return 
 - `pandas `:  (bool, optional) Return a pandas dataframe 
 - `keys `:  (list, optional) Only return metrics for specific keys 
 - `x_axis `:  (str, optional) Use this metric as the xAxis defaults to _step 
 - `stream `:  (str, optional) "default" for metrics, "system" for machine metrics 



**Returns:**
 
 - `pandas.DataFrame`:  If pandas=True returns a `pandas.DataFrame` of history  metrics. 
 - `list of dicts`:  If pandas=False returns a list of dicts of history metrics. 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.load`

```python
load(force=False)
```





---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.log_artifact`

```python
log_artifact(
    artifact: 'wandb.Artifact',
    aliases: 'Collection[str] | None' = None,
    tags: 'Collection[str] | None' = None

artifact = wandb.Artifact("test_artifact", type="dataset")
artifact.add_file(tmp_path)
run.log_artifact(artifact)
run.finish()

finished_run = api.run(f"{run.entity}/{run.project}/{run.id}")

for logged_artifact in finished_run.logged_artifacts():
    print(logged_artifact.name)
``` 

---

### <kbd>method</kbd> `Run.save`

```python
used_artifacts(per_page: 'int' = 100) → public.RunArtifacts

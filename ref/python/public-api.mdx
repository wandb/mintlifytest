The W&B Public API provides programmatic access to query, export, and update data stored in W&B. Use this API for post-hoc analysis, data export, and programmatic management of runs, artifacts, and sweeps. While the main SDK handles real-time logging during training, the Public API enables you to retrieve historical data, update metadata, manage artifacts, and perform analysis on completed experiments. The main `Api` class serves as the entry point to most functionality.

## Available Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`Api`](/ref/python/public-api/api/) | Main entry point for the Public API. Query runs, projects, and artifacts across your organization. |
| [`Runs`](/ref/python/public-api/runs/) | Access and manage individual training runs, including history, logs, and metrics. |
| [`Artifacts`](/guides/artifacts/) | Query and download model artifacts, datasets, and other versioned files. |
| [`Sweeps`](/guides/sweeps/) | Access hyperparameter sweep data and analyze optimization results. |
| [`Projects`](/ref/python/public-api/projects/) | Manage projects and access project-level metadata and settings. |
| [`Reports`](/guides/reports/create-a-report/) | Programmatically access and manage W&B Reports. |
| [`Teams`](/ref/python/public-api/Team/) | Query team information and manage team-level resources. |
| [`Users`](/ref/python/public-api/User/) | Access user profiles and user-specific data. |
| [`Files`](/ref/python/public-api/files/) | Download and manage files associated with runs. |
| [`History`](/ref/python/public-api/history/) | Access detailed time-series metrics logged during training. |
| [`Automations`](./automations/) | Manage automated workflows and actions. |
| [`Integrations`](/guides/integrations/) | Configure and manage third-party integrations. |

## Common Use Cases

### Data Export and Analysis
- Export run history as DataFrames for analysis in Jupyter notebooks
- Download metrics for custom visualization or reporting
- Aggregate results across multiple experiments

### Post-Hoc Updates
- Update run metadata after completion
- Add tags or notes to completed experiments
- Modify run configurations or summaries

### Artifact Management
- Query artifacts by version or alias
- Download model checkpoints programmatically
- Track artifact lineage and dependencies

### Sweep Analysis
- Access sweep results and best performing runs
- Export hyperparameter search results
- Analyze parameter importance

## Authentication

The Public API uses the same authentication mechanism as the Python SDK. You can authenticate in several ways:

Use the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable to set your API key:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Pass the API key directly when initializing the `Api` class:

```python
api = Api(api_key="your_api_key")
```

Or use `wandb.login()` to authenticate the current session:
```python
import wandb

wandb.login()
api = Api()
```


## Example Usage


### Download an Artifact by name and alias

The following example shows how to retrieve an artifact logged to W&B by its name and alias, and then download its contents.

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
artifact = api.artifact("entity/project/artifact:alias")
artifact.download()
```

### Download an Artifact from a registry

The following example shows how to retrieve a linked artifact from a W&B Registry

```python
import wandb

REGISTRY = "<registry_name>"
COLLECTION = "<collection_name>"
VERSION = "<version>"

api = wandb.Api()
artifact_name = f"wandb-registry-{REGISTRY}/{COLLECTION}:{VERSION}"

# Fetch the artifact
fetched_artifact = api.artifact(name = artifact_name)

# Download artifact. Returns path to downloaded contents
downloaded_path = fetched_artifact.download()
```

### Query W&B Registry 

Use Mongo-like filters to query W&B Registries, Collections, and Artifacts. The following example demonstrates how to filter collections by name using a regular expression.

```python
import wandb

# Initialize wandb API
api = wandb.Api()

# Filter all collections, independent of registry, that 
# contains the string `yolo` in the collection name
collection_filters = {
    "name": {"$regex": "yolo"}
}

# Returns an iterable of all collections that match the filters
collections = api.registries().collections(filter=collection_filters)
```

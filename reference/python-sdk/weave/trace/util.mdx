--- title: "Trace Utilities" description: "Utility functions and classes for tracing, including ThreadPoolExecutor" --- The trace utilities module provides helper functions and classes for advanced tracing scenarios. ## ThreadPoolExecutor A context-aware ThreadPoolExecutor that preserves trace context across thread boundaries. ```python from weave import ThreadPoolExecutor @weave.op def process_item(item: str) -> str: return item.upper() @weave.op def process_batch(items: List[str]) -> List[str]: with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor: # Each item is processed in parallel while maintaining trace context results = list(executor.map(process_item, items)) return results ``` ### Key Features - Preserves parent-child relationships in traces - Maintains trace context across thread boundaries - Compatible with standard ThreadPoolExecutor API ### Example with Nested Tracing ```python @weave.op def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict: # Simulated API call return {"data": f"from {url}"} @weave.op def process_urls(urls: List[str]) -> List[dict]: with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor: # All fetch_data calls will be properly nested under process_urls results = list(executor.map(fetch_data, urls)) return results # Usage urls = ["http://api1.com", "http://api2.com", "http://api3.com"] data = process_urls(urls) ``` ## attributes Context manager for adding attributes to calls. ```python from weave import attributes @weave.op def my_function(): return "result" # Add metadata to the call with attributes({'environment': 'production', 'version': '1.0.0'}): my_function() ``` ### Nested Attributes Attributes can be nested and will merge: ```python with attributes({'env': 'prod'}): with attributes({'region': 'you-east-1'}): # Call will have both attributes my_function() ``` ## set_tracing_enabled Context manager to temporarily disable tracing. ```python from weave.trace.context.call_context import set_tracing_enabled @weave.op def traced_function(): return "This will be traced" # Temporarily disable tracing with set_tracing_enabled(False): traced_function() # This call won't be traced # Tracing is automatically re-enabled outside the context traced_function() # This will be traced ``` ## get_current_call Get the currently executing call within an op. ```python from weave.trace.context import get_current_call @weave.op def my_function(): call = get_current_call() if call: print(f"Current call ID: {call.id}") print(f"Current call inputs: {call.inputs}") ``` ## Summary Utilities ### add_summary Add custom summary metrics to a call. ```python @weave.op def evaluate_model(prompt: str) -> str: result = model.generate(prompt) # Add custom metrics to the call summary call = get_current_call() if call: call.summary.update({ 'token_count': len(result.split()), 'confidence': 0.95 }) return result ``` <Note> These utilities are designed to work seamlessly with Weave's tracing system. Always ensure `weave.init()` has been called before using these features. </Note>

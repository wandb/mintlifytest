title: How can admins restrict which users have modify access?

Control access to certain queue fields for users who are not team administrators through [queue config templates](/launch/set-up-launch/setup-queue-advanced). Team administrators define which fields non-admin users can view, and set the editing limits. Only team administrators have the ability to create or edit queues.

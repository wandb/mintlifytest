title: Can you group runs by tags?
---

A run can have multiple tags, so grouping by tags is not supported. Add a value to the [`config`](/guides/track/config/) object for these runs and group by this config value instead. This can be accomplished using [the API](/guides/track/config/#set-the-configuration-after-your-run-has-finished).

title: How can I change how frequently to log system metrics?
---

To configure the frequency to log [system metrics](/ref/system-metrics.md), set `_stats_sampling_interval` to a number of seconds, expressed as a float. Default: `10.0`.

```python
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(x_stats_sampling_interval=30.0))
```

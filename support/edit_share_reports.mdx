title: Who can edit and share reports?
---

Reports created within an individual's private project remain visible only to that user. The user can share their project with a team or the public.

In team projects, the administrator or the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit and view access for other team members. Team members can share reports.

To share a report, select the **Share** button in the upper right corner. Provide an email address or copy the magic link. Users invited by email must log into W&B to view the report, while users with a magic link do not need to log in.

Shared reports maintain view-only access.

title: What is the difference between `.log()` and `.summary`?
---

The summary displays in the table, while the log saves all values for future plotting.

For instance, call `run.log()` whenever accuracy changes. By default, `run.log()` updates the summary value unless set manually for that metric.

The scatterplot and parallel coordinate plots use the summary value, while the line plot shows all values recorded by `run.log`.

Some users prefer to set the summary manually to reflect the optimal accuracy instead of the most recent accuracy logged.

title: How can I log additional metrics after a run completes?
---

There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init()`](/guides/models/track/create-an-experiment.md) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab](/guides/models/track/project-page.md#runs-tab) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init()` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init()` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`run.log()`](/guides/models/track/log/) or `run.summary()`, and the run values will update accordingly.

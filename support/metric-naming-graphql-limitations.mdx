title: Why can't I sort or filter metrics with certain characters?
---

Metric names in W&B must follow GraphQL naming conventions to ensure they can be properly sorted and filtered in the UI.

## Valid metric names

<Text/>

Metrics that don't follow these rules may not be sortable or filterable in the W&B UI.

## Examples

<Text2/>

## Recommended solution

Replace invalid characters with valid characters such as underscores:
- Instead of `"test acc"`, use `"test_acc"`
- Instead of `"loss-train"`, use `"loss_train"`
- Instead of `"acc,val"`, use `"acc_val"`

title: Why does the storage meter not update after deleting runs?
---

- The storage meter does not update immediately after deleting runs due to processing delays. 
- The backend system requires time to synchronize and reflect changes in usage accurately. 
- If the storage meter has not updated, wait for the changes to process.

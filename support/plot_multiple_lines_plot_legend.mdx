title: How do I plot multiple lines on a plot with a legend?
---

Create a multi-line custom chart with `wandb.plot.line_series()`. Navigate to the [project page](/guides/models/track/project-page.md) to view the line chart. To add a legend, include the `keys` argument in `wandb.plot.line_series()`. For example:

```python

with wandb.init(project="my_project") as run:

    run.log(
        {
            "my_plot": wandb.plot.line_series(
                xs=x_data, ys=y_data, keys=["metric_A", "metric_B"]
            )
        }
    )
```

Refer to additional details about multi-line plots [here](/guides/models/track/log/plots.md#basic-charts) under the **Multi-line** tab.

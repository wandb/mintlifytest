title: What is the difference between team and entity? As a user - what does entity
  mean for me?
---

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An entity represents either a username or a team name. When logging runs in W&B, set the entity to a personal or team account using `wandb.init(entity="example-team")`.

title: How do I programmatically access the human-readable run name?
---

The `.name` attribute of a [`wandb.Run`](/ref/python/experiments/run/) is accessible as follows:

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init() as run:
   run_name = run.name
   print(f"The human-readable run name is: {run_name}")
```

title: How do you show a "step slider" in a custom chart?

Enable this option on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. Changing the query to use a `historyTable` instead of a `summaryTable` provides the option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This feature includes a slider for selecting the step.

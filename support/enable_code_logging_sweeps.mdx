title: How do I enable code logging with Sweeps?
---

To enable code logging for sweeps, add `wandb.log_code()` after initializing the W&B Run. This action is necessary even when code logging is enabled in the W&B profile settings. For advanced code logging, refer to the [docs for `wandb.log_code()` here](/ref/python/experiments/run/#log_code).

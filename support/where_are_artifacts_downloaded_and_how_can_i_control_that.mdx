title: Where are artifacts downloaded, and how can I control that?
---

By default, artifacts download to the `artifacts/` folder. To change the location:

- Pass it to [`wandb.Artifact().download`](/ref/python/public-api/api.md):

    ```python
    wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path_to_download>")
    ```

- Set the `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR` [environment variable](guides/models/track/environment-variables.md):

    ```python
    import os
    os.environ["WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR"] = "<path_to_download>"
    ```

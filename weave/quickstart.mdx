The following Quickstart uses an embedded notebook hosted by Deepnote so you can try out W&B Weave 
without setting up an environment on your local machine.

After providing your API key and running the notebook, you will get live URLs to explore 
the W&B Weave dashboard and observe what happened when your LLM code was executed.

After running this notebook with your API keys, you should have live Weave dashboards that
allow you to deep dive on Weave's observability functionality.

## Install Weave and set up your environment

First install the required libraries:

```shell
pnpm install weave dotenv
```

Then, retrieve your Weights & Biases API key from https://wandb.ai/authorize and your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. 

Set up environment variables by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY="your_wandb_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

If you use the `.env` file approach, make sure to import dotenv at the top of your TypeScript file:

```typescript
import 'dotenv/config';  // Add this at the top of your file
```

## Track your LLM calls

Add Weave tracking to the functions you want to track:

```typescript
// If using .env file, add this line:
// import 'dotenv/config';
import OpenAI from 'openai';
// highlight-next-line
import * as weave from 'weave';

// highlight-next-line
const openai = new OpenAI();

async function extractDinos(input: string) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `In JSON format extract a list of 'dinosaurs', with their 'name', their 'common_name', and whether its 'diet' is a herbivore or carnivore: ${input}`,
      },
    ],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
// highlight-next-line
const extractDinosOp = weave.op(extractDinos);

async function main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  await weave.init('examples');
  const result = await extractDinosOp(
    'I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below.'
  );
  console.log(result);
}

main();

```
When you call the `extractDinos` function Weave will output a link to view your trace.

## Next steps

Now that you've seen Weave in action, try the W&B Inference service for easier experimentation. [Get Started with W&B Inference](/weave/quickstart-inference) - no need to manage multiple API keys, and free credits are included.

Continue learning:
- [Track flows and app metadata](/weave/tutorial-tracing_2) - Dive deeper into tracing complex applications
- [Build evaluations](/weave/tutorial-eval) - Learn systematic model evaluation  
- [Explore integrations](./guides/integrations/index) - Connect more LLM providers and frameworks
- Try the [Playground](./guides/tools/playground) to test different models

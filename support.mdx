<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
## Who has access to my artifacts?

Artifacts inherit access permissions from their parent project:

* In a private project, only team members can access artifacts.
* In a public project, all users can read artifacts, while only team members can create or modify them.
* In an open project, all users can read and write artifacts.

## Artifacts Workflows

This section outlines workflows for managing and editing Artifacts. Many workflows utilize [the W&B API](/guides/models/track/public-api-guide.md), a component of [the client library](/ref/python/) that provides access to W&B-stored data.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## How can I access the data logged to my runs directly and programmatically?

The history object tracks metrics logged with `wandb.log`. Access the history object using the API:

```python
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("username/project/run_id")
print(run.history())
```
</Update>

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
## Is there a way to add extra values to a sweep, or do I need to start a new one?

Once a W&B Sweep starts, you cannot change the Sweep configuration. However, you can navigate to any table view, select runs using the checkboxes, and then choose the **Create sweep** menu option to generate a new Sweep configuration based on previous runs.

## How do I add Plotly or Bokeh Charts into Tables?

Direct integration of Plotly or Bokeh figures into tables is not supported. Instead, export the figures to HTML and include the HTML in the table. Below are examples demonstrating this with interactive Plotly and Bokeh charts.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Using Plotly">
```python
import wandb
import plotly.express as px

# Initialize a new run
with wandb.init(project="log-plotly-fig-tables", name="plotly_html") as run:

    # Create a table
    table = wandb.Table(columns=["plotly_figure"])

    # Define path for Plotly figure
    path_to_plotly_html = "./plotly_figure.html"

    # Create a Plotly figure
    fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])

    # Export Plotly figure to HTML
    # Setting auto_play to False prevents animated Plotly charts from playing automatically
    fig.write_html(path_to_plotly_html, auto_play=False)

    # Add Plotly figure as HTML file to the table
    table.add_data(wandb.Html(path_to_plotly_html))

    ```

* **No profile or settings pages**: The UI does not include certain pages, as they are only useful for real accounts.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Artifacts", "Storage"]}>
## How much storage does each artifact version use?

Only files that change between two artifact versions incur storage costs.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/artifacts/artifacts-dedupe.PNG" alt="Artifact deduplication"/>
</Frame>

Consider an image artifact named `animals` that contains two image files, `cat.png` and `dog.png`:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
```

This artifact receives version `v0`.

When adding a new image, `rat.png`, a new artifact version, `v1`, is created with the following contents:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- rat.png (3MB) # Added in `v1`
```

Version `v1` tracks a total of 6MB, but occupies only 3MB of space since it shares the remaining 3MB with `v0`. Deleting `v1` reclaims the 3MB of storage associated with `rat.png`. Deleting `v0` transfers the storage costs of `cat.png` and `dog.png` to `v1`, increasing its storage size to 6MB.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
## Using artifacts with multiple architectures and runs?

There are various methods to version a model. Artifacts provide a tool for model versioning tailored to specific needs. A common approach for projects that explore multiple model architectures involves separating artifacts by architecture. Consider the following steps:

1. Create a new artifact for each distinct model architecture. Use the `metadata` attribute of artifacts to provide detailed descriptions of the architecture, similar to the use of `config` for a run.
2. For each model, log checkpoints periodically with `log_artifact`. W&B builds a history of these checkpoints, labeling the most recent one with the `latest` alias. Refer to the latest checkpoint for any model architecture using `architecture-name:latest`.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Artifacts", "Sweeps"]}>
## How do I best log models from runs in a sweep?

One effective approach for logging models in a [sweep](/guides/models/sweeps/) involves creating a model artifact for the sweep. Each version represents a different run from the sweep. Implement it as follows:

```python
wandb.Artifact(name="sweep_name", type="model")
```
</Update>

<Update tags={["Hyperparameter", "Sweeps", "Runs"]}>
## Best practices to organize hyperparameter searches

Set unique tags with `wandb.init(tags='your_tag')`. This allows efficient filtering of project runs by selecting the corresponding tag in a Project Page's Runs Table. 

For more information on `wandb.init()`, see the [`wandb.init()` reference](/ref/python/sdk/functions/init.md).

</Update>

<Update tags={["Python"]}>
## Does the W&B client support Python 2?

The W&B client library supported both Python 2.7 and Python 3 through version 0.10. Support for Python 2.7 discontinued with version 0.11 due to Python 2's end of life. Running `pip install --upgrade wandb` on a Python 2.7 system installs only new releases of the 0.10.x series. Support for the 0.10.x series includes critical bug fixes and patches only. The last version of the 0.10.x series that supports Python 2.7 is 0.10.33.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Python"]}>
## Does the W&B client support Python 3.5?

The W&B client library supported Python 3.5 until version 0.11. Support for Python 3.5 ended with version 0.12, which aligns with its end of life. For more details, visit [version 0.12 release notes](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases/tag/v0.12.0).

If options to revert are unavailable because of a closed session, consider discarding the draft or editing from the last saved version. If neither works, contact W&B Support.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Crashing And Hanging Runs"]}>
## If wandb crashes, will it possibly crash my training run?

It is critical to avoid interference with training runs. W&B operates in a separate process, ensuring that training continues even if W&B experiences a crash. In the event of an internet outage, W&B continually retries sending data to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).
</Update>

<Update tags={["User Management"]}>
## Is it possible to create a new account with an email that was previously used for a deleted account?

<Update tags={["Team Management"]}>
## Who can create a team? Who can add or delete people from a team? Who can delete projects?

Refer to the link for details on roles and permissions: [Team Roles and Permissions](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams.md#team-roles-and-permissions).
</Update>

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
## How do I use custom CLI commands with sweeps?

You can use W&B Sweeps with custom CLI commands if training configuration passes command-line arguments.

In the example below, the code snippet illustrates a bash terminal where a user trains a Python script named `train.py`, providing values that the script parses:

```bash
/usr/bin/env python train.py -b \
    your-training-config \
    --batchsize 8 \
    --lr 0.00001
```

To implement custom commands, modify the `command` key in the YAML file. Based on the previous example, the configuration appears as follows:

```yaml
program:
  train.py
method: grid
parameters:
  batch_size:
    value: 8
  lr:
    value: 0.0001
command:
  - ${env}
  - python
  - ${program}
  - "-b"
  - your-training-config
  - ${args}
```

The `${args}` key expands to all parameters in the sweep configuration, formatted for `argparse` as `--param1 value1 --param2 value2`.

For additional arguments outside of `argparse`, implement the following:

```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()
```

<Note>
Depending on the environment, `python` might refer to Python 2. To ensure invocation of Python 3, use `python3` in the command configuration:

```yaml
program:
  script.py
command:
  - ${env}
  - python3
  - ${program}
  - ${args}
```
</Note>
</Update>

<Update tags={["Workspaces"]}>
## Is there a dark mode?

Dark mode is in beta and not optimized for accessibility. To enable dark mode:

1. Go to your [W&B account settings](https://wandb.ai/settings).
2. Scroll to the **Public preview features** section.
3. In **UI Display**, select **Dark mode** from the dropdown.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Connectivity"]}>
## How do I deal with network issues?

If you encounter SSL or network errors, such as `wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop`, use the following solutions:

1. Upgrade the SSL certificate. On an Ubuntu server, run `update-ca-certificates`. A valid SSL certificate is essential for syncing training logs to mitigate security risks.
2. If the network connection is unstable, operate in offline mode by setting the [optional environment variable](/guides/models/track/environment-variables.md#optional-environment-variables) `WANDB_MODE` to `offline`, and sync files later from a device with Internet access.
3. Consider using [W&B Private Hosting](/guides/hosting/), which runs locally and avoids syncing to cloud servers.

For the `SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error, this issue might stem from a company firewall. Configure local CAs and execute:

`export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
</Update>

## I didn't name my run. Where is the run name coming from?

If a run is not explicitly named, W&B assigns a random name to identify it in your project. Examples of random names are `pleasant-flower-4` and `misunderstood-glade-2.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Charts"]}>
## What is the difference between `.log()` and `.summary`?

The summary displays in the table, while the log saves all values for future plotting.

For instance, call `run.log()` whenever accuracy changes. By default, `run.log()` updates the summary value unless set manually for that metric.

The scatterplot and parallel coordinate plots use the summary value, while the line plot shows all values recorded by `run.log`.

Some users prefer to set the summary manually to reflect the optimal accuracy instead of the most recent accuracy logged.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Team Management"]}>
## What is the difference between team and entity? As a user - what does entity mean for me?

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An entity represents either a username or a team name. When logging runs in W&B, set the entity to a personal or team account using `wandb.init(entity="example-team")`.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Team Management", "Administrator"]}>
## What is the difference between team and organization?

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An organization functions as a higher-level entity that can include multiple teams, often related to billing and account management.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## What is the difference between wandb.init modes?

These modes are available:

* `online` (default): The client sends data to the wandb server.
* `offline`: The client stores data locally on the machine instead of sending it to the wandb server. Use the [`wandb sync`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync.md) command to synchronize the data later.
* `disabled`: The client simulates operation by returning mocked objects and prevents any network communication. All logging is turned off, but all API method stubs remain callable. This mode is typically used for testing.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Tensorboard"]}>
## How is W&B different from TensorBoard?

W&B integrates with TensorBoard and improves experiment tracking tools. The founders created W&B to address common frustrations faced by TensorBoard users. Key improvements include:

1. **Model Reproducibility**: W&B facilitates experimentation, exploration, and model reproduction. It captures metrics, hyperparameters, code versions, and saves model checkpoints to ensure reproducibility.

2. **Automatic Organization**: W&B streamlines project handoffs and vacations by providing an overview of all attempted models, which saves time by preventing the re-execution of old experiments.

3. **Quick Integration**: Integrate W&B into your project in five minutes. Install the free open-source Python package and add a few lines of code. Logged metrics and records appear with each model run.

4. **Centralized Dashboard**: Access a consistent dashboard regardless of where training occurs—locally, on lab clusters, or cloud spot instances. Eliminate the need to manage TensorBoard files across different machines.

5. **Robust Filtering Table**: Search, filter, sort, and group results from various models efficiently. Easily identify the best-performing models for different tasks, an area where TensorBoard often struggles with larger projects.

6. **Collaboration Tools**: W&B enhances collaboration for complex machine learning projects. Share project links and utilize private teams for result sharing. Create reports with interactive visualizations and markdown descriptions for work logs or presentations.

## Who can edit and share reports?

Reports created within an individual's private project remain visible only to that user. The user can share their project with a team or the public.

In team projects, the administrator or the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit and view access for other team members. Team members can share reports.

To share a report, select the **Share** button in the upper right corner. Provide an email address or copy the magic link. Users invited by email must log into W&B to view the report, while users with a magic link do not need to log in.

Shared reports maintain view-only access.

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
## How do I enable code logging with Sweeps?

To enable code logging for sweeps, add `wandb.log_code()` after initializing the W&B Run. This action is necessary even when code logging is enabled in the W&B profile settings. For advanced code logging, refer to the [docs for `wandb.log_code()` here](/ref/python/sdk/classes/run#log_code).
</Update>

<Update tags={["Environment Variables"]}>
## Do environment variables overwrite the parameters passed to wandb.init()?

Arguments passed to `wandb.init` override environment variables. To set a default directory other than the system default when the environment variable isn't set, use `wandb.init(dir=os.getenv("WANDB_DIR", my_default_override))`.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Sweeps", "Hyperparameter"]}>
## What is the `Est. Runs` column?

W&B provides an estimated number of Runs generated when creating a W&B Sweep with a discrete search space. This total reflects the cartesian product of the search space.

For instance, consider the following search space:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/sweeps/sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_1.png" alt="Estimated runs column" />
</Frame>

In this case, the Cartesian product equals 9. W&B displays this value in the App UI as the estimated run count (**Est. Runs**):

<Frame>
<img src="/images/sweeps/spaces_sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_2.webp" alt="Sweep run estimation" />
</Frame>

To retrieve the estimated Run count programmatically, use the `expected_run_count` attribute of the Sweep object within the W&B SDK:

```python
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(
    sweep_configs, project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name"
)
api = wandb.Api()
sweep = api.sweep(f"your_entity_name/your_project_name/sweeps/{sweep_id}")
print(f"EXPECTED RUN COUNT = {sweep.expected_run_count}")
```

def encode_base64(username, key):
    auth_string = f'{username}:{key}'
    return base64.b64encode(auth_string.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')

username = ''  # Organization admin username
key = ''  # API key
scim_base_url = 'https://api.wandb.ai/scim/v2'
users_endpoint = f'{scim_base_url}/Users'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Basic {encode_base64(username, key)}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/scim+json'
}

response = requests.get(users_endpoint, headers=headers)
users = []
for user in response.json()['Resources']:
    users.append([user['userName'], user['emails']['Value']])
```

Modify the script to save the output as needed.

## How can I fetch these Version IDs and ETags in W&B?

If an artifact reference is logged with W&B and versioning is enabled on the buckets, the version IDs appear in the Amazon S3 UI. To retrieve these version IDs and ETags in W&B, fetch the artifact and access the corresponding manifest entries. For example:

```python
artifact = run.use_artifact("my_table:latest")
for entry in artifact.manifest.entries.values():
    versionID = entry.extra.get("versionID")
    etag = entry.extra.get("etag")

## How can I find the artifacts logged or consumed by a run? How can I find the runs that produced or consumed an artifact?

W&B tracks artifacts logged by each run and those used by each run to construct an artifact graph. This graph is a bipartite, directed, acyclic graph with nodes representing runs and artifacts. An example can be viewed [here](https://wandb.ai/shawn/detectron2-11/artifacts/dataset/furniture-small-val/06d5ddd4deeb2a6ebdd5/graph) (click "Explode" to expand the graph).

Use the Public API to navigate the graph programmatically, starting from either an artifact or a run.

## Can we flag boolean variables as hyperparameters?

Use the `${args_no_boolean_flags}` macro in the command section of the configuration to pass hyperparameters as boolean flags. This macro automatically includes boolean parameters as flags. If `param` is `True`, the command receives `--param`. If `param` is `False`, the flag is omitted.

## How do I fix Invalid Authentication (401) errors with W&B Inference?

A 401 Invalid Authentication error means your API key is invalid or your W&B project entity/name is incorrect.

## Verify your API key

1. Get a new API key at [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)
2. Check for extra spaces or missing characters when copying
3. Store your API key securely

## Check your project configuration

Ensure your project is formatted correctly as `<your-team>/<your-project>`:

**Python example:**
```python
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',
    api_key="<your-api-key>",
    project="<your-team>/<your-project>",  # Must match your W&B team and project
)
```

**Bash example:**
```bash
curl https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: <your-team>/<your-project>"
```

## Common mistakes

- Using personal entity instead of team name
- Misspelling team or project name
- Missing forward slash between team and project
- Using an expired or deleted API key

## Still having issues?

- Verify the team and project exist in your W&B account
- Ensure you have access to the specified team
- Try creating a new API key if the current one isn't working
</Update>

<Update tags={["Inference"]}>
## What are the best practices for handling W&B Inference errors?

Follow these best practices to handle W&B Inference errors gracefully and maintain reliable applications.

## 1. Always implement error handling

Wrap API calls in try-except blocks:

```python
import openai

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        messages=messages
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Handle error appropriately
```

## 2. Use retry logic with exponential backoff

```python
import time
from typing import Optional

def call_inference_with_retry(
    client, 
    messages, 
    model: str,
    max_retries: int = 3,
    base_delay: float = 1.0
) -> Optional[str]:
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages
            )
            return response.choices[0].message.content
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            
            # Calculate delay with exponential backoff
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed, retrying in {delay}s...")
            time.sleep(delay)
    
    return None
```

## 3. Monitor your usage

- Track credit usage in the W&B Billing page
- Set up alerts before hitting limits
- Log API usage in your application

## 4. Handle specific error codes

```python
def handle_inference_error(error):
    error_str = str(error)
    
    if "401" in error_str:
        # Invalid authentication
        raise ValueError("Check your API key and project configuration")
    elif "429" in error_str:
        if "quota" in error_str:
            # Out of credits
            raise ValueError("Insufficient credits")
        else:
            # Rate limited
            return "retry"
    elif "500" in error_str or "503" in error_str:
        # Server error
        return "retry"
    else:
        # Unknown error
        raise
```

## 5. Set appropriate timeouts

Configure reasonable timeouts for your use case:

```python
# For longer responses
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',
    api_key="your-api-key",
    timeout=60.0  # 60 second timeout
)
```

## Additional tips

- Log errors with timestamps for debugging
- Use async operations for better concurrency handling
- Implement circuit breakers for production systems
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

## Why does W&B Inference say my country or region is not supported?

A 403 error with the message "Country, region, or territory not supported" means you're accessing W&B Inference from an unsupported location.

## Why this happens

W&B Inference has geographic restrictions due to compliance and regulatory requirements. The service is only accessible from supported geographic locations.

## What you can do

1. **Check the Terms of Service**
   - Review the [Terms of Service](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/policies/terms-of-service/terms-of-use#geographic-restrictions) for the current list of supported locations

2. **Use from a supported location**
   - Access the service when in a supported country or region
   - Consider using your organization's resources in supported locations

3. **Contact your account team**
   - Enterprise customers can discuss options with their account executive
   - Some organizations may have special arrangements

## Error details

When you see this error:
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Country, region, or territory not supported"
  }
}
```

This is determined by your IP address location at the time of the API request.

## Why isn't W&B Inference available for my personal account?

Personal accounts don't support W&B Inference. You'll see this 429 error: "W&B Inference isn't available for personal accounts. Please switch to a non-personal account to access W&B Inference."

## Background

Personal entities were deprecated in May 2024. This only affects legacy accounts that still use personal entities.

## How to access W&B Inference

### Create a Team

1. Log in to your W&B account
2. Click on your profile icon in the top right
3. Select "Create new team"
4. Choose a team name
5. Use this team for W&B Inference requests

### Update your code

Change from personal entity to team:

**Before (doesn't work):**
```python
project="your-username/project-name"  # Personal entity
```

**After (works):**
```python
project="your-team/project-name"  # Team entity
```

## Benefits of using Teams

- Access to W&B Inference
- Better collaboration features
- Shared projects and resources
- Team-based billing and usage tracking

<Update tags={["Inference"]}>
## Why am I getting rate limit errors (429) with W&B Inference?

Rate limit errors (429) occur when you exceed concurrency limits or run out of credits.

## Types of 429 errors

### Concurrency limit reached
**Error:** "Concurrency limit reached for requests"

**Solution:**
- Reduce the number of parallel requests
- Add delays between requests
- Implement exponential backoff
- Note: Rate limits apply per W&B project

### Quota exceeded
**Error:** "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"

**Solution:**
- Check your credit balance in the W&B Billing page
- Purchase more credits or upgrade your plan
- Request a limit increase from support

### Personal account limitation
**Error:** "W&B Inference isn't available for personal accounts"

**Solution:**
- Switch to a non-personal account
- Create a Team to access W&B Inference
- Personal entities were deprecated in May 2024

## Best practices to avoid rate limits

1. **Implement retry logic with exponential backoff:**
   ```python
   import time
   
   def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
       for i in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return func()
           except Exception as e:
               if "429" in str(e) and i < max_retries - 1:
                   time.sleep(2 ** i)
               else:
                   raise
   ```

2. **Use batch processing instead of parallel requests**

3. **Monitor your usage in the W&B Billing page**

## Default spending caps

- **Pro accounts:** $6,000/month
- **Enterprise accounts:** $700,000/year

Contact your account executive or support to adjust limits.

## How do I fix server errors (500, 503) with W&B Inference?

Server errors indicate temporary issues with the W&B Inference service.

## Error types

### 500 - Internal Server Error
**Message:** "The server had an error while processing your request"

This is a temporary internal error on the server side.

### 503 - Service Overloaded
**Message:** "The engine is currently overloaded, please try again later"

The service is experiencing high traffic.

## How to handle server errors

1. **Wait before retrying**
   - 500 errors: Wait 30-60 seconds
   - 503 errors: Wait 60-120 seconds

2. **Use exponential backoff**
   ```python
   import time
   import openai
   
   def call_with_retry(client, messages, model, max_retries=5):
       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return client.chat.completions.create(
                   model=model,
                   messages=messages
               )
           except Exception as e:
               if "500" in str(e) or "503" in str(e):
                   if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                       wait_time = min(60, (2 ** attempt))
                       time.sleep(wait_time)
                   else:
                       raise
               else:
                   raise
   ```

3. **Set appropriate timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values for your HTTP client
   - Consider async operations for better handling

## When to contact support

Contact support if:
- Errors persist for more than 10 minutes
- You see patterns of failures at specific times
- Error messages contain additional details

Provide:
- Error messages and codes
- Time when errors occurred
- Your code snippet (remove API keys)
- W&B entity and project names

## How do I install the wandb Python library in environments without gcc?

If an error occurs when installing `wandb` that states:

```
unable to execute 'gcc': No such file or directory
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Install `psutil` directly from a pre-built wheel. Determine your Python version and operating system at [https://pywharf.github.io/pywharf-pkg-repo/psutil](https://pywharf.github.io/pywharf-pkg-repo/psutil).

For example, to install `psutil` on Python 3.8 in Linux:

```bash
WHEEL_URL=https://github.com/pywharf/pywharf-pkg-repo/releases/download/psutil-5.7.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl#sha256=adc36dabdff0b9a4c84821ef5ce45848f30b8a01a1d5806316e068b5fd669c6d
pip install $WHEEL_URL

## What if I want to integrate W&B into my project, but I don't want to upload any images or media?

W&B supports projects that log only scalars by allowing explicit specification of files or data for upload. Refer to this [example in PyTorch](https://wandb.me/pytorch-colab) that demonstrates logging without using images.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Environment Variables", "Outage"]}>
## What happens if internet connection is lost while I'm training a model?

If the library cannot connect to the internet, it enters a retry loop and continues to attempt to stream metrics until the network is restored. The program continues to run during this time.

To run on a machine without internet, set `WANDB_MODE=offline`. This configuration stores metrics locally on the hard drive. Later, call `wandb sync DIRECTORY` to stream the data to the server.

<Update tags={["Administrator", "Team Management", "Metrics"]}>
## Can I just log metrics, no code or dataset examples?

By default, W&B does not log dataset examples. By default, W&B logs code and system metrics.

Two methods exist to turn off code logging with environment variables:

1. Set `WANDB_DISABLE_CODE` to `true` to turn off all code tracking. This action prevents retrieval of the git SHA and the diff patch.
2. Set `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS` to `*.patch` to stop syncing the diff patch to the servers, while keeping it available locally for application with `wandb restore`.

As an administrator, you can also turn off code saving for your team in your team's settings:

1. Navigate to the settings of your team at `https://wandb.ai/<team>/settings`. Where `<team>` is the name of your team.
2. Scroll to the Privacy section.
3. Toggle **Enable code saving by default**.

## How do I kill a job with wandb?

Press `Ctrl+D` on the keyboard to stop a script instrumented with W&B.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## How do I launch multiple runs from one script?

Finish previous runs before starting new runs to log multiple runs within
a single script.

The recommended way to do this is by using `wandb.init()` as a context manager
because this finishes the run and marks it as failed if your script raises an
exception:

```python
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    with wandb.init() as run:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})
```

You can also call `run.finish()` explicitly:

```python
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init()

    try:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})

    except Exception:
        run.finish(exit_code=1)
        raise

    finally:
        run.finish()
```

## Multiple active runs

Starting with wandb 0.19.10, you can set the `reinit` setting to `"create_new"`
to create multiple simultaneously active runs.

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(reinit="create_new") as tracking_run:
    for x in range(10):
        with wandb.init(reinit="create_new") as run:
            for y in range(100):
                run.log({"x_plus_y": x + y})

## How can I log additional metrics after a run completes?

There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init()`](/guides/models/track/create-an-experiment.md) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab](/guides/models/track/project-page.md#runs-tab) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init()` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init()` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`run.log()`](/guides/models/track/log/) or `run.summary()`, and the run values will update accordingly.

<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
## How do I log an artifact to an existing run?

Occasionally, it is necessary to mark an artifact as the output of a previously logged run. In this case, reinitialize the old run and log new artifacts as follows:

## How can I log a metric that doesn't change over time such as a final evaluation accuracy?

Using `run.log({'final_accuracy': 0.9})` updates the final accuracy correctly. By default, `run.log({'final_accuracy': <value>})` updates `run.settings['final_accuracy']`, which reflects the value in the runs table.
</Update>

## What if I want to log some metrics on batches and some metrics only on epochs?

To log specific metrics in each batch and standardize plots, log the desired x-axis values alongside the metrics. In the custom plots, click edit and select a custom x-axis.

with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log({"batch": batch_idx, "loss": 0.3})
    run.log({"epoch": epoch, "val_acc": 0.94})

</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments", "Metrics"]}>
## Can I log metrics on two different time scales?

For example, I want to log training accuracy per batch and validation accuracy per epoch.

Yes, log indices like `batch` and `epoch` alongside your metrics. Use `wandb.Run.log()({'train_accuracy': 0.9, 'batch': 200})` in one step and `wandb.Run.log()({'val_accuracy': 0.8, 'epoch': 4})` in another. In the UI, set the desired value as the x-axis for each chart. To set a default x-axis for a specific index, use [Run.define_metric()](/ref/python/sdk/classes/run#define_metric). For the example provided, use the following code:

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init() as run:
   run.define_metric("batch")
   run.define_metric("epoch")

   run.define_metric("train_accuracy", step_metric="batch")
   run.define_metric("val_accuracy", step_metric="epoch")
```

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## What happens when I log millions of steps to W&B? How is that rendered in the browser?

The number of points sent affects the loading time of graphs in the UI. For lines exceeding 1,000 points, the backend samples the data down to 1,000 points before sending it to the browser. This sampling is nondeterministic, resulting in different sampled points upon page refresh.

Log fewer than 10,000 points per metric. Logging over 1 million points in a line significantly increases page load time. Explore strategies to minimize logging footprint without sacrificing accuracy in this [Colab](https://wandb.me/log-hf-colab). With more than 500 columns of config and summary metrics, only 500 display in the table.

<Update tags={["Logs"]}>
## How do I log to the right wandb user on a shared machine?

When using a shared machine, ensure that runs log to the correct WandB account by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. If sourced in the environment, this variable provides the correct credentials upon login. Alternatively, set the environment variable directly in the script.

Execute the command `export WANDB_API_KEY=X`, replacing X with your API key. Logged-in users can find their API key at [wandb.ai/authorize](https://app.wandb.ai/authorize).
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## Does logging block my training?

"Is the logging function lazy? I don't want to depend on the network to send results to your servers while executing local operations."

The `wandb.log` function writes a line to a local file and does not block network calls. When calling `wandb.init`, a new process starts on the same machine. This process listens for filesystem changes and communicates with the web service asynchronously, allowing local operations to continue uninterrupted.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Logs"]}>
## How do I turn off logging?

The command `wandb offline` sets the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline`, preventing data from syncing to the remote W&B server. This action affects all projects, stopping the logging of data to W&B servers.

To suppress warning messages, use the following code:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## Why can't I sort or filter metrics with certain characters?

Metric names in W&B must follow GraphQL naming conventions to ensure they can be properly sorted and filtered in the UI.

## Valid metric names

* **Allowed characters**: Letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_)
* **Starting character**: Names must start with a letter or underscore
* **Pattern**: Metric names should match `/^[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`

Metrics that don't follow these rules may not be sortable or filterable in the W&B UI.

## Examples

**Valid metric names:**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "val_loss": 0.1, "epoch_5": 5})
  run.log({"modelAccuracy": 0.95, "learning_rate": 0.001})
```

**Invalid metric names (avoid these):**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"acc,val": 0.9})  # Contains comma
  run.log({"loss-train": 0.1})  # Contains hyphen
  run.log({"test acc": 0.95})  # Contains space
  run.log({"5_fold_cv": 0.8})  # Starts with number
```


## Recommended solution

Replace invalid characters with valid characters such as underscores:
- Instead of `"test acc"`, use `"test_acc"`
- Instead of `"loss-train"`, use `"loss_train"`
- Instead of `"acc,val"`, use `"acc_val"`

## Is it possible to move a run from one project to another?

You can move a run from one project to another by following these steps:

- Navigate to the project page with the run to be moved.
- Click on the **Runs** tab to open the runs table.
- Select the runs to move.
- Click the **Move** button.
- Choose the destination project and confirm the action.

W&B supports moving runs through the UI, but does not support copying runs. Artifacts logged with the runs do not transfer to the new project. To move artifacts to the run's new location manually, you can use the [`wandb artifact get`](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-get/) SDK command or the [`Api.artifact` API](/ref/python/public-api/api/#artifact) to download the artifact, then use [wandb artifact put](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-put/) or the `Api.artifact` API to upload it to the run's new location.

## How can I use wandb with multiprocessing, e.g. distributed training?

If a training program uses multiple processes, structure the program to avoid making wandb method calls from processes without `wandb.init()`. 

Manage multiprocess training using these approaches:

1. Call `wandb.init` in all processes and use the [group](/guides/models/track/runs/grouping.md) keyword argument to create a shared group. Each process will have its own wandb run, and the UI will group the training processes together.
2. Call `wandb.init` from only one process and pass data to log through [multiprocessing queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes).

<Note>
Refer to the [Distributed Training Guide](/guides/models/track/log/distributed-training.md) for detailed explanations of these approaches, including code examples with Torch DDP.
</Note>
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## Does W&B use the `multiprocessing` library?

Yes, W&B uses the `multiprocessing` library. An error message like the following indicates a possible issue:

```
An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process 
has finished its bootstrapping phase.
```

To resolve this, add an entry point protection with `if __name__ == "__main__":`. This protection is necessary when running W&B directly from the script.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
## Do I need to provide values for all hyperparameters as part of the W&B Sweep. Can I set defaults?

Access hyperparameter names and values from the sweep configuration using `(run.config())`, which acts like a dictionary.

For runs outside a sweep, set `wandb.Run.config()` values by passing a dictionary to the `config` argument in `wandb.init()`. In a sweep, any configuration supplied to `wandb.init()` serves as a default value, which the sweep can override.

Use `rwandb.Run.config.setdefaults()` for explicit behavior. The following code snippets illustrate both methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="wandb.init()">
```python
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run and provide defaults
# that a sweep can override
with wandb.init(config=config_defaults) as run:
    # Add training code here
    ...
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="config.setdefaults()">
```python
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run
with wandb.init() as run:
    # Update any values not set by the sweep
    run.config.setdefaults(config_defaults)

    # Add training code here
```
</Tab>

## Optimizing multiple metrics

To optimize multiple metrics in a single run, use a weighted sum of the individual metrics.

```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  # Log individual metrics
  metric_a = run.summary.get("metric_a", 0.5)
  metric_b = run.summary.get("metric_b", 0.7)
  # ... log other metrics as needed
  metric_n = run.summary.get("metric_n", 0.9)

  # Combine metrics with weights
  # Adjust weights according to your optimization goals
  # For example, if you want to give more importance to metric_a and metric_n:  
  metric_combined = 0.3 * metric_a + 0.2 * metric_b + ... + 1.5 * metric_n
  run.log({"metric_combined": metric_combined})
```

Log the new combined metric and set it as the optimization objective:

```yaml
metric:
  name: metric_combined
  goal: minimize
```
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## How can I organize my logged charts and media in the W&B UI?

The `/` character separates logged panels in the W&B UI. By default, the segment of the logged item's name before the `/` defines a group of panels known as a "Panel Section."

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init() as run:

   run.log({"val/loss": 1.1, "val/acc": 0.3})
   run.log({"train/loss": 0.1, "train/acc": 0.94})

2. **Log results quickly**: Users can repeatedly run the script and instantly view results in the W&B dashboard. These unclaimed anonymous runs remain available for 7 days.
3. **Claim data when it's useful**: Once a user identifies valuable results in W&B, they can click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. Without claiming, the run data deletes after 7 days.

<Warning>
**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links permit anyone to view and claim experiment results for 7 days, so share links only with trusted individuals. For publicly sharing results while hiding the author's identity, contact support@wandb.com for assistance.

2. When ready to upload, run `wandb init` in your directory to set the project name. 
3. Use `wandb sync YOUR_RUN_DIRECTORY` to transfer metrics to the cloud service and access results in the hosted web app.

To confirm the run is offline, check `run.settings._offline` or `run.settings.mode` after executing `wandb.init()`.

## My run's state is `crashed` on the UI but is still running on my machine. What do I do to get my data back?

You likely lost connection to your machine during training. Recover data by running [`wandb sync [PATH_TO_RUN]`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync.md). The path to your run is a folder in your `wandb` directory that matches the Run ID of the ongoing run.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## Why is the same metric appearing more than once?

When logging various data types under the same key, split them in the database. This results in multiple entries of the same metric name in the UI dropdown. The data types grouped are `number`, `string`, `bool`, `other` (primarily arrays), and any `wandb` data type such as `Histogram` or `Image`. Send only one type per key to prevent this issue.

Metric names are case-insensitive. Avoid using names that differ only by case, such as `"My-Metric"` and `"my-metric"`.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
## How do I save code?‌

Use `save_code=True` in `wandb.init` to save the main script or notebook that launches the run. To save all code for a run, version the code with Artifacts. The following example demonstrates this process:

```python
code_artifact = wandb.Artifact(type="code")
code_artifact.add_file("./train.py")
wandb.log_artifact(code_artifact)
```
</Update>

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
## How can I save the git commit associated with my run?

When `wandb.init` is invoked, the system automatically collects git information, including the remote repository link and the SHA of the latest commit. This information appears on the [run page](/guides/models/track/runs/#view-logged-runs). Ensure the current working directory when executing the script is within a git-managed folder to view this information.

The git commit and the command used to run the experiment remain visible to the user but are hidden from external users. In public projects, these details remain private.

<Update tags={["Experiments", "Environment Variables", "Metrics"]}>
## Is it possible to save metrics offline and sync them to W&B later?

By default, `wandb.init` starts a process that syncs metrics in real time to the cloud. For offline use, set two environment variables to enable offline mode and sync later.

Set the following environment variables:

1. `WANDB_API_KEY=$KEY`, where `$KEY` is the API Key from your [settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings).
2. `WANDB_MODE="offline"`.

Here is an example of implementing this in a script:

```python
import wandb
import os

os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "offline"

config = {
    "dataset": "CIFAR10",
    "machine": "offline cluster",
    "model": "CNN",
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "batch_size": 128,
}

with wandb.init(project="offline-demo") as run:
    for i in range(100):
        run.log({"accuracy": i})
```

Sample terminal output is shown below:

<Update tags={["Experiments", "Metrics"]}>
## Why am I seeing fewer data points than I logged?

When visualizing metrics against an X-axis other than `Step`, expect to see fewer data points. Metrics must log at the same `Step` to remain synchronized. Only metrics logged at the same `Step` are sampled while interpolating between samples.

**Guidelines**

Bundle metrics into a single `log()` call. For example, instead of:

```python
import wandb
with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log({"Precision": precision})
    ...
    run.log({"Recall": recall})
```

Use:

```python
import wandb
with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall})
```

For manual control over the step parameter, synchronize metrics in the code as follows:

```python
with wandb.init() as run:
    step = 100  # Example step value
    # Log Precision and Recall at the same step
    run.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall}, step=step)
```

Ensure the `step` value remains the same in both `log()` calls for the metrics to log under the same step and sample together. The `step` value must increase monotonically in each call. Otherwise, the `step` value is ignored.

## How can I send run alerts to Microsoft Teams?

To receive W&B alerts in Teams, follow these steps:

- **Set up an email address for your Teams channel.** Create an email address for the Teams channel where you want to receive alerts.

## What is a service account, and why is it useful?

A **service account** represents a non-human or machine identity, which can automate common tasks across teams and projects. Service accounts are ideal for CI/CD pipelines, automated training jobs, and other machine-to-machine workflows.

Key benefits of service accounts:
- **No license consumption**: Service accounts do not consume user seats or licenses
- **Dedicated API keys**: Secure credentials for automated workflows
- **User attribution**: Optionally attribute automated runs to human users
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built for production automation at scale
- **Delegated operations**: Service accounts operate on behalf of the user or organization that creates them

Among other things, service accounts are useful for tracking automated jobs logged to wandb, like periodic retraining, nightly builds, and so on. If you'd like, you can associate a username with one of these machine-launched runs with the [environment variables](/guides/models/track/environment-variables.md) `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL`.

For comprehensive information about service accounts, including best practices and detailed setup instructions, refer to [Use service accounts to automate workflows](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/service-accounts.md). For information about how service accounts behave in team contexts, refer to [Team Service Account Behavior](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams.md#team-service-account-behavior).

You can get the API key for a service account in your team at `<WANDB_HOST_URL>/<your-team-name>/service-accounts`. Alternatively you can go to the **Team settings** for your team and then refer to the **Service Accounts** tab. 

To create a new service account for your team:
* Press the **+ New service account** button in the **Service Accounts** tab of your team
* Provide a name in the **Name** field
* Select **Generate API key (Built-in)** as the authentication method
* Press the **Create** button
* Click the **Copy API key** button for the newly created service account and store it in a secret manager or another safe but accessible location

<Note>
Apart from the **Built-in** service accounts, W&B also supports **External service accounts** using [identity federation for SDK and CLI](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/identity_federation.md#external-service-accounts). Use external service accounts if you are looking to automate W&B tasks using service identities managed in your identity provider that can issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## How do I silence W&B info messages?

To suppress log messages in your notebook such as this:

```
INFO SenderThread:11484 [sender.py:finish():979]
``` 

Set the log level to `logging.ERROR` to only show errors, suppressing output of info-level log output.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

To significantly reduce log output, set `WANDB_QUIET` environment variable to `True`. To turn off log output completely, set the `WANDB_SILENT` environment variable to `True`. In a notebook, set `WANDB_QUIET` or `WANDB_SILENT` before running `wandb.login`:

## Will wandb slow down my training?

W&B has a minimal impact on training performance under normal usage conditions. Normal use includes logging at a rate of less than once per second and limiting data to a few megabytes per step. W&B operates in a separate process with non-blocking function calls, ensuring that brief network outages or intermittent disk read/write issues do not disrupt performance. Excessive logging of large amounts of data may lead to disk I/O issues. For further inquiries, contact support.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Security"]}>
## Does W&B support SSO for Multi-tenant?

W&B supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Multi-tenant offering through Auth0. SSO integration is compatible with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, such as Okta or Azure AD. To configure an OIDC provider, follow these steps:

* Create a Single Page Application (SPA) on the identity provider.
* Set the `grant_type` to `implicit` flow.
* Set the callback URI to `https://wandb.auth0.com/login/callback`.

**Requirements for W&B**

After completing the setup, contact the customer success manager (CSM) with the `Client ID` and `Issuer URL` for the application. W&B will establish an Auth0 connection using these details and enable SSO.

<Update tags={["Environment Variables"]}>
## How does wandb stream logs and writes to disk?

W&B queues events in memory and writes them to disk asynchronously to manage failures and support the `WANDB_MODE=offline` configuration, allowing synchronization after logging.

In the terminal, observe the path to the local run directory. This directory includes a `.wandb` file, which serves as the datastore. For image logging, W&B stores images in the `media/images` subdirectory before uploading them to cloud storage.
</Update>

<Update tags={["Sweeps", "Aws"]}>
## Can you use W&B Sweeps with cloud infrastructures such as AWS Batch, ECS, etc.?

To publish the `sweep_id` so that any W&B Sweep agent can access it, implement a method for these agents to read and execute the `sweep_id`.

For example, launch an Amazon EC2 instance and execute `wandb agent` on it. Use an SQS queue to broadcast the `sweep_id` to multiple EC2 instances. Each instance can then retrieve the `sweep_id` from the queue and initiate the process.
</Update>

## What does wandb.init do to my training process?

When `wandb.init()` runs in a training script, an API call creates a run object on the servers. A new process starts to stream and collect metrics, allowing the primary process to function normally.

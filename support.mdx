<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
<Accordion title="Who has access to my artifacts?">

Artifacts inherit access permissions from their parent project:

* In a private project, only team members can access artifacts.
* In a public project, all users can read artifacts, while only team members can create or modify them.
* In an open project, all users can read and write artifacts.

## Artifacts Workflows

This section outlines workflows for managing and editing Artifacts. Many workflows utilize [the W&B API](/guides/models/track/public-api-guide.md), a component of [the client library](/ref/python/) that provides access to W&B-stored data.

<Update tags={["Artifacts", "Storage"]}>
<Accordion title="How much storage does each artifact version use?">

Only files that change between two artifact versions incur storage costs.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/artifacts/artifacts-dedupe.PNG" alt="Artifact deduplication"/>
</Frame>

Consider an image artifact named `animals` that contains two image files, `cat.png` and `dog.png`:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
```

This artifact receives version `v0`.

When adding a new image, `rat.png`, a new artifact version, `v1`, is created with the following contents:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- rat.png (3MB) # Added in `v1`
```

Version `v1` tracks a total of 6MB, but occupies only 3MB of space since it shares the remaining 3MB with `v0`. Deleting `v1` reclaims the 3MB of storage associated with `rat.png`. Deleting `v0` transfers the storage costs of `cat.png` and `dog.png` to `v1`, increasing its storage size to 6MB.

<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
<Accordion title="Using artifacts with multiple architectures and runs?">

There are various methods to version a model. Artifacts provide a tool for model versioning tailored to specific needs. A common approach for projects that explore multiple model architectures involves separating artifacts by architecture. Consider the following steps:

1. Create a new artifact for each distinct model architecture. Use the `metadata` attribute of artifacts to provide detailed descriptions of the architecture, similar to the use of `config` for a run.
2. For each model, log checkpoints periodically with `log_artifact`. W&B builds a history of these checkpoints, labeling the most recent one with the `latest` alias. Refer to the latest checkpoint for any model architecture using `architecture-name:latest`.
</Accordion>

<Update tags={["Artifacts", "Sweeps"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I best log models from runs in a sweep?">

One effective approach for logging models in a [sweep](/guides/models/sweeps/) involves creating a model artifact for the sweep. Each version represents a different run from the sweep. Implement it as follows:

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I use custom CLI commands with sweeps?">

You can use W&B Sweeps with custom CLI commands if training configuration passes command-line arguments.

In the example below, the code snippet illustrates a bash terminal where a user trains a Python script named `train.py`, providing values that the script parses:

```bash
/usr/bin/env python train.py -b \
    your-training-config \
    --batchsize 8 \
    --lr 0.00001
```

To implement custom commands, modify the `command` key in the YAML file. Based on the previous example, the configuration appears as follows:

```yaml
program:
  train.py
method: grid
parameters:
  batch_size:
    value: 8
  lr:
    value: 0.0001
command:
  - ${env}
  - python
  - ${program}
  - "-b"
  - your-training-config
  - ${args}
```

The `${args}` key expands to all parameters in the sweep configuration, formatted for `argparse` as `--param1 value1 --param2 value2`.

For additional arguments outside of `argparse`, implement the following:

```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()
```

<Note>
Depending on the environment, `python` might refer to Python 2. To ensure invocation of Python 3, use `python3` in the command configuration:

```yaml
program:
  script.py
command:
  - ${env}
  - python3
  - ${program}
  - ${args}
```

<Update tags={["Connectivity"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I deal with network issues?">

If you encounter SSL or network errors, such as `wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop`, use the following solutions:

1. Upgrade the SSL certificate. On an Ubuntu server, run `update-ca-certificates`. A valid SSL certificate is essential for syncing training logs to mitigate security risks.
2. If the network connection is unstable, operate in offline mode by setting the [optional environment variable](/guides/models/track/environment-variables.md#optional-environment-variables) `WANDB_MODE` to `offline`, and sync files later from a device with Internet access.
3. Consider using [W&B Private Hosting](/guides/hosting/), which runs locally and avoids syncing to cloud servers.

For the `SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error, this issue might stem from a company firewall. Configure local CAs and execute:

`export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

These modes are available:

* `online` (default): The client sends data to the wandb server.
* `offline`: The client stores data locally on the machine instead of sending it to the wandb server. Use the [`wandb sync`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync.md) command to synchronize the data later.
* `disabled`: The client simulates operation by returning mocked objects and prevents any network communication. All logging is turned off, but all API method stubs remain callable. This mode is typically used for testing.

<Update tags={["Tensorboard"]}>
<Accordion title="How is W&B different from TensorBoard?">

W&B integrates with TensorBoard and improves experiment tracking tools. The founders created W&B to address common frustrations faced by TensorBoard users. Key improvements include:

1. **Model Reproducibility**: W&B facilitates experimentation, exploration, and model reproduction. It captures metrics, hyperparameters, code versions, and saves model checkpoints to ensure reproducibility.

2. **Automatic Organization**: W&B streamlines project handoffs and vacations by providing an overview of all attempted models, which saves time by preventing the re-execution of old experiments.

3. **Quick Integration**: Integrate W&B into your project in five minutes. Install the free open-source Python package and add a few lines of code. Logged metrics and records appear with each model run.

4. **Centralized Dashboard**: Access a consistent dashboard regardless of where training occurs—locally, on lab clusters, or cloud spot instances. Eliminate the need to manage TensorBoard files across different machines.

5. **Robust Filtering Table**: Search, filter, sort, and group results from various models efficiently. Easily identify the best-performing models for different tasks, an area where TensorBoard often struggles with larger projects.

6. **Collaboration Tools**: W&B enhances collaboration for complex machine learning projects. Share project links and utilize private teams for result sharing. Create reports with interactive visualizations and markdown descriptions for work logs or presentations.

<Update tags={["Sweeps", "Hyperparameter"]}>
<Accordion title="What is the `Est. Runs` column?">

W&B provides an estimated number of Runs generated when creating a W&B Sweep with a discrete search space. This total reflects the cartesian product of the search space.

For instance, consider the following search space:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/sweeps/sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_1.png" alt="Estimated runs column" />
</Frame>

In this case, the Cartesian product equals 9. W&B displays this value in the App UI as the estimated run count (**Est. Runs**):

<Frame>
<img src="/images/sweeps/spaces_sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_2.webp" alt="Sweep run estimation" />
</Frame>

To retrieve the estimated Run count programmatically, use the `expected_run_count` attribute of the Sweep object within the W&B SDK:

```python
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(
    sweep_configs, project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name"
)
api = wandb.Api()

<Accordion title="How do I fix Invalid Authentication (401) errors with W&B Inference?">

A 401 Invalid Authentication error means your API key is invalid or your W&B project entity/name is incorrect.

## Verify your API key

1. Get a new API key at [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)
2. Check for extra spaces or missing characters when copying
3. Store your API key securely

## Check your project configuration

Ensure your project is formatted correctly as `<your-team>/<your-project>`:

**Python example:**
```python
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',
    api_key="<your-api-key>",
    project="<your-team>/<your-project>",  # Must match your W&B team and project
)
```

**Bash example:**
```bash
curl https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: <your-team>/<your-project>"
```

## Common mistakes

- Using personal entity instead of team name
- Misspelling team or project name
- Missing forward slash between team and project
- Using an expired or deleted API key

## Still having issues?

- Verify the team and project exist in your W&B account
- Ensure you have access to the specified team
- Try creating a new API key if the current one isn't working

</Update>

<Update tags={["Inference"]}>
<Accordion title="What are the best practices for handling W&B Inference errors?">

Follow these best practices to handle W&B Inference errors gracefully and maintain reliable applications.

## 1. Always implement error handling

Wrap API calls in try-except blocks:

```python
import openai

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        messages=messages
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Handle error appropriately
```

## 2. Use retry logic with exponential backoff

```python
import time
from typing import Optional

def call_inference_with_retry(
    client, 
    messages, 
    model: str,
    max_retries: int = 3,
    base_delay: float = 1.0
) -> Optional[str]:
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages
            )
            return response.choices[0].message.content
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            
            # Calculate delay with exponential backoff
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed, retrying in {delay}s...")
            time.sleep(delay)
    
    return None
```

## 3. Monitor your usage

- Track credit usage in the W&B Billing page
- Set up alerts before hitting limits
- Log API usage in your application

## 4. Handle specific error codes

```python
def handle_inference_error(error):
    error_str = str(error)
    
    if "401" in error_str:
        # Invalid authentication
        raise ValueError("Check your API key and project configuration")
    elif "429" in error_str:
        if "quota" in error_str:
            # Out of credits
            raise ValueError("Insufficient credits")
        else:
            # Rate limited
            return "retry"
    elif "500" in error_str or "503" in error_str:
        # Server error
        return "retry"
    else:
        # Unknown error
        raise
```

## 5. Set appropriate timeouts

Configure reasonable timeouts for your use case:

```python
# For longer responses
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',
    api_key="your-api-key",
    timeout=60.0  # 60 second timeout
)
```

## Additional tips

- Log errors with timestamps for debugging
- Use async operations for better concurrency handling
- Implement circuit breakers for production systems
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

<Accordion title="Why does W&B Inference say my country or region is not supported?">

A 403 error with the message "Country, region, or territory not supported" means you're accessing W&B Inference from an unsupported location.

## Why this happens

W&B Inference has geographic restrictions due to compliance and regulatory requirements. The service is only accessible from supported geographic locations.

## What you can do

1. **Check the Terms of Service**
   - Review the [Terms of Service](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/policies/terms-of-service/terms-of-use#geographic-restrictions) for the current list of supported locations

2. **Use from a supported location**
   - Access the service when in a supported country or region
   - Consider using your organization's resources in supported locations

3. **Contact your account team**
   - Enterprise customers can discuss options with their account executive
   - Some organizations may have special arrangements

## Error details

When you see this error:
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Country, region, or territory not supported"
  }
}

<Accordion title="Why isn't W&B Inference available for my personal account?">

Personal accounts don't support W&B Inference. You'll see this 429 error: "W&B Inference isn't available for personal accounts. Please switch to a non-personal account to access W&B Inference."

## Background

Personal entities were deprecated in May 2024. This only affects legacy accounts that still use personal entities.

## How to access W&B Inference

### Create a Team

1. Log in to your W&B account
2. Click on your profile icon in the top right
3. Select "Create new team"
4. Choose a team name
5. Use this team for W&B Inference requests

### Update your code

Change from personal entity to team:

**Before (doesn't work):**
```python
project="your-username/project-name"  # Personal entity
```

**After (works):**
```python
project="your-team/project-name"  # Team entity
```

## Benefits of using Teams

- Access to W&B Inference

<Accordion title="Why am I getting rate limit errors (429) with W&B Inference?">

Rate limit errors (429) occur when you exceed concurrency limits or run out of credits.

## Types of 429 errors

### Concurrency limit reached
**Error:** "Concurrency limit reached for requests"

**Solution:**
- Reduce the number of parallel requests
- Add delays between requests
- Implement exponential backoff
- Note: Rate limits apply per W&B project

### Quota exceeded
**Error:** "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"

**Solution:**
- Check your credit balance in the W&B Billing page
- Purchase more credits or upgrade your plan
- Request a limit increase from support

### Personal account limitation
**Error:** "W&B Inference isn't available for personal accounts"

**Solution:**
- Switch to a non-personal account
- Create a Team to access W&B Inference
- Personal entities were deprecated in May 2024

## Best practices to avoid rate limits

1. **Implement retry logic with exponential backoff:**
   ```python
   import time
   
   def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
       for i in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return func()
           except Exception as e:
               if "429" in str(e) and i < max_retries - 1:
                   time.sleep(2 ** i)
               else:
                   raise
   ```

2. **Use batch processing instead of parallel requests**

3. **Monitor your usage in the W&B Billing page**

## Default spending caps

- **Pro accounts:** $6,000/month
- **Enterprise accounts:** $700,000/year

Contact your account executive or support to adjust limits.

## How to handle server errors

1. **Wait before retrying**
   - 500 errors: Wait 30-60 seconds
   - 503 errors: Wait 60-120 seconds

2. **Use exponential backoff**
   ```python
   import time
   import openai
   
   def call_with_retry(client, messages, model, max_retries=5):
       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return client.chat.completions.create(
                   model=model,
                   messages=messages
               )
           except Exception as e:
               if "500" in str(e) or "503" in str(e):
                   if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                       wait_time = min(60, (2 ** attempt))
                       time.sleep(wait_time)
                   else:
                       raise
               else:
                   raise

1. Set `WANDB_DISABLE_CODE` to `true` to turn off all code tracking. This action prevents retrieval of the git SHA and the diff patch.
2. Set `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS` to `*.patch` to stop syncing the diff patch to the servers, while keeping it available locally for application with `wandb restore`.

As an administrator, you can also turn off code saving for your team in your team's settings:

1. Navigate to the settings of your team at `https://wandb.ai/<team>/settings`. Where `<team>` is the name of your team.
2. Scroll to the Privacy section.
3. Toggle **Enable code saving by default**.

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I launch multiple runs from one script?">

Finish previous runs before starting new runs to log multiple runs within
a single script.

The recommended way to do this is by using `wandb.init()` as a context manager
because this finishes the run and marks it as failed if your script raises an
exception:

```python
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    with wandb.init() as run:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})
```

You can also call `run.finish()` explicitly:

```python
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init()

    try:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})

    except Exception:
        run.finish(exit_code=1)
        raise

    finally:
        run.finish()
```

## Multiple active runs

Starting with wandb 0.19.10, you can set the `reinit` setting to `"create_new"`
to create multiple simultaneously active runs.

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(reinit="create_new") as tracking_run:
    for x in range(10):
        with wandb.init(reinit="create_new") as run:
            for y in range(100):
                run.log({"x_plus_y": x + y})

            tracking_run.log({"x": x})
```

See [Multiple runs per process](guides/models/track/runs/multiple-runs-per-process.md)

<Accordion title="How can I log additional metrics after a run completes?">

There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init()`](/guides/models/track/create-an-experiment.md) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab](/guides/models/track/project-page.md#runs-tab) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init()` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init()` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`run.log()`](/guides/models/track/log/) or `run.summary()`, and the run values will update accordingly.

<Accordion title="What happens when I log millions of steps to W&B? How is that rendered in the browser?">

The number of points sent affects the loading time of graphs in the UI. For lines exceeding 1,000 points, the backend samples the data down to 1,000 points before sending it to the browser. This sampling is nondeterministic, resulting in different sampled points upon page refresh.

Log fewer than 10,000 points per metric. Logging over 1 million points in a line significantly increases page load time.

<Accordion title="Does logging block my training?">

"Is the logging function lazy? I don't want to depend on the network to send results to your servers while executing local operations."

The `wandb.log` function writes a line to a local file and does not block network calls. When calling `wandb.init`, a new process starts on the same machine. This process listens for filesystem changes and communicates with the web service asynchronously, allowing local operations to continue uninterrupted.

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
<Accordion title="Why can't I sort or filter metrics with certain characters?">

Metric names in W&B must follow GraphQL naming conventions to ensure they can be properly sorted and filtered in the UI.

## Valid metric names

* **Allowed characters**: Letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_)
* **Starting character**: Names must start with a letter or underscore
* **Pattern**: Metric names should match `/^[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`

Metrics that don't follow these rules may not be sortable or filterable in the W&B UI.

## Examples

**Valid metric names:**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "val_loss": 0.1, "epoch_5": 5})
  run.log({"modelAccuracy": 0.95, "learning_rate": 0.001})
```

**Invalid metric names (avoid these):**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"acc,val": 0.9})  # Contains comma
  run.log({"loss-train": 0.1})  # Contains hyphen
  run.log({"test acc": 0.95})  # Contains space
  run.log({"5_fold_cv": 0.8})  # Starts with number
```


## Recommended solution

Replace invalid characters with valid characters such as underscores:
- Instead of `"test acc"`, use `"test_acc"`
- Instead of `"loss-train"`, use `"loss_train"`
- Instead of `"acc,val"`, use `"acc_val"`

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
<Accordion title="How can I use wandb with multiprocessing, e.g. distributed training?">

If a training program uses multiple processes, structure the program to avoid making wandb method calls from processes without `wandb.init()`. 

Manage multiprocess training using these approaches:

1. Call `wandb.init` in all processes and use the [group](/guides/models/track/runs/grouping.md) keyword argument to create a shared group. Each process will have its own wandb run, and the UI will group the training processes together.
2. Call `wandb.init` from only one process and pass data to log through [multiprocessing queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes).

<Note>
Refer to the [Distributed Training Guide](/guides/models/track/log/distributed-training.md) for detailed explanations of these approaches, including code examples with Torch DDP.

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
<Accordion title="Does W&B use the `multiprocessing` library?">

Yes, W&B uses the `multiprocessing` library. An error message like the following indicates a possible issue:

```
An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process 
has finished its bootstrapping phase.
```

To resolve this, add an entry point protection with `if __name__ == "__main__":`. This protection is necessary when running W&B directly from the script.

<Update tags={["Sweeps"]}>
<Accordion title="Do I need to provide values for all hyperparameters as part of the W&B Sweep. Can I set defaults?">

Access hyperparameter names and values from the sweep configuration using `(run.config())`, which acts like a dictionary.

For runs outside a sweep, set `wandb.Run.config()` values by passing a dictionary to the `config` argument in `wandb.init()`. In a sweep, any configuration supplied to `wandb.init()` serves as a default value, which the sweep can override.

Use `rwandb.Run.config.setdefaults()` for explicit behavior. The following code snippets illustrate both methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="wandb.init()">
```python
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

  metric_a = run.summary.get("metric_a", 0.5)
  metric_b = run.summary.get("metric_b", 0.7)
  # ... log other metrics as needed
  metric_n = run.summary.get("metric_n", 0.9)

  # Combine metrics with weights
  # Adjust weights according to your optimization goals
  # For example, if you want to give more importance to metric_a and metric_n:  
  metric_combined = 0.3 * metric_a + 0.2 * metric_b + ... + 1.5 * metric_n
  run.log({"metric_combined": metric_combined})

<Update tags={["Experiments"]}>
<Accordion title="How can I organize my logged charts and media in the W&B UI?">

- **Check log-in credentials**: Confirm log-in to the correct W&B account. Test by creating a run with the following code:
  ```python
  import wandb

  run = wandb.init(entity="your_entity", project="your_project")
  run.log({'example_metric': 1})
  run.finish()
  ```
- **Set API key**: Use the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable:
  ```bash
  export WANDB_API_KEY='your_api_key'
  ```
- **Confirm host information**: For custom deployments, set the host URL:
  ```bash
  wandb login --relogin --host=<host-url>
  export WANDB_BASE_URL=<host-url>
  ```

</Accordion>
</Update>

<Update tags={["Anonymous"]}>
<Accordion title="How does someone without an account see run results?">

If someone runs the script with `anonymous="allow"`:

1. **Auto-create temporary account**: W&B checks for a signed-in account. If none exists, W&B creates a new anonymous account and saves the API key for that session.
2. **Log results quickly**: Users can repeatedly run the script and instantly view results in the W&B dashboard. These unclaimed anonymous runs remain available for 7 days.
3. **Claim data when it's useful**: Once a user identifies valuable results in W&B, they can click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. Without claiming, the run data deletes after 7 days.

<Warning>
**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links permit anyone to view and claim experiment results for 7 days, so share links only with trusted individuals. For publicly sharing results while hiding the author's identity, contact support@wandb.com for assistance.
</Warning>

When a W&B user finds and runs the script, their results log correctly to their account, just like a normal run.

<Accordion title="Can I run wandb offline?">

If training occurs on an offline machine, use the following steps to upload results to the servers:

1. Set the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline` to save metrics locally without an internet connection.
2. When ready to upload, run `wandb init` in your directory to set the project name. 
3. Use `wandb sync YOUR_RUN_DIRECTORY` to transfer metrics to the cloud service and access results in the hosted web app.

To confirm the run is offline, check `run.settings._offline` or `run.settings.mode` after executing `wandb.init()`.

<Update tags={["Artifacts"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I save code?‌">

Use `save_code=True` in `wandb.init` to save the main script or notebook that launches the run. To save all code for a run, version the code with Artifacts. The following example demonstrates this process:

```python
code_artifact = wandb.Artifact(type="code")

<Update tags={["Experiments", "Environment Variables", "Metrics"]}>
<Accordion title="Is it possible to save metrics offline and sync them to W&B later?">

By default, `wandb.init` starts a process that syncs metrics in real time to the cloud. For offline use, set two environment variables to enable offline mode and sync later.

Set the following environment variables:

1. `WANDB_API_KEY=$KEY`, where `$KEY` is the API Key from your [settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings).
2. `WANDB_MODE="offline"`.

Here is an example of implementing this in a script:

```python
import wandb
import os

os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "offline"

config = {
    "dataset": "CIFAR10",
    "machine": "offline cluster",
    "model": "CNN",
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "batch_size": 128,
}

with wandb.init(project="offline-demo") as run:
    for i in range(100):
        run.log({"accuracy": i})

<Update tags={["Experiments", "Metrics"]}>
<Accordion title="Why am I seeing fewer data points than I logged?">

When visualizing metrics against an X-axis other than `Step`, expect to see fewer data points. Metrics must log at the same `Step` to remain synchronized. Only metrics logged at the same `Step` are sampled while interpolating between samples.

**Guidelines**

Bundle metrics into a single `log()` call. For example, instead of:

```python
import wandb
with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log({"Precision": precision})
    ...
    run.log({"Recall": recall})
```

Use:

```python
import wandb
with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall})
```

For manual control over the step parameter, synchronize metrics in the code as follows:

```python
with wandb.init() as run:
    step = 100  # Example step value
    # Log Precision and Recall at the same step
    run.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall}, step=step)
```

Ensure the `step` value remains the same in both `log()` calls for the metrics to log under the same step and sample together. The `step` value must increase monotonically in each call. Otherwise, the `step` value is ignored.

<Update tags={["Administrator"]}>
<Accordion title="What is a service account, and why is it useful?">

A **service account** represents a non-human or machine identity, which can automate common tasks across teams and projects. Service accounts are ideal for CI/CD pipelines, automated training jobs, and other machine-to-machine workflows.

Key benefits of service accounts:
- **No license consumption**: Service accounts do not consume user seats or licenses
- **Dedicated API keys**: Secure credentials for automated workflows
- **User attribution**: Optionally attribute automated runs to human users
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built for production automation at scale
- **Delegated operations**: Service accounts operate on behalf of the user or organization that creates them

Among other things, service accounts are useful for tracking automated jobs logged to wandb, like periodic retraining, nightly builds, and so on. If you'd like, you can associate a username with one of these machine-launched runs with the [environment variables](/guides/models/track/environment-variables.md) `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL`.

For comprehensive information about service accounts, including best practices and detailed setup instructions, refer to [Use service accounts to automate workflows](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/service-accounts.md). For information about how service accounts behave in team contexts, refer to [Team Service Account Behavior](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams.md#team-service-account-behavior).

You can get the API key for a service account in your team at `<WANDB_HOST_URL>/<your-team-name>/service-accounts`. Alternatively you can go to the **Team settings** for your team and then refer to the **Service Accounts** tab. 

To create a new service account for your team:
* Press the **+ New service account** button in the **Service Accounts** tab of your team
* Provide a name in the **Name** field
* Select **Generate API key (Built-in)** as the authentication method
* Press the **Create** button
* Click the **Copy API key** button for the newly created service account and store it in a secret manager or another safe but accessible location

<Note>
Apart from the **Built-in** service accounts, W&B also supports **External service accounts** using [identity federation for SDK and CLI](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/identity_federation.md#external-service-accounts). Use external service accounts if you are looking to automate W&B tasks using service identities managed in your identity provider that can issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

<Update tags={["Notebooks", "Environment Variables"]}>
<Accordion title="How do I silence W&B info messages?">

To suppress log messages in your notebook such as this:

```
INFO SenderThread:11484 [sender.py:finish():979]
``` 

Set the log level to `logging.ERROR` to only show errors, suppressing output of info-level log output.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

To significantly reduce log output, set `WANDB_QUIET` environment variable to `True`. To turn off log output completely, set the `WANDB_SILENT` environment variable to `True`. In a notebook, set `WANDB_QUIET` or `WANDB_SILENT` before running `wandb.login`:

W&B supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Multi-tenant offering through Auth0. SSO integration is compatible with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, such as Okta or Azure AD. To configure an OIDC provider, follow these steps:

* Create a Single Page Application (SPA) on the identity provider.
* Set the `grant_type` to `implicit` flow.
* Set the callback URI to `https://wandb.auth0.com/login/callback`.

**Requirements for W&B**

After completing the setup, contact the customer success manager (CSM) with the `Client ID` and `Issuer URL` for the application. W&B will establish an Auth0 connection using these details and enable SSO.

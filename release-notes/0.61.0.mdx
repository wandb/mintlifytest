## Features

**This is a mini-feature and patch release, delivered at a different schedule than the monthly W&B server major releases**

* Organization admins can now configure Models seats and access control for both Models & [W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) in a seamless manner from their organization dashboard. This change allows for a efficient user management when [Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is enabled for a Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed instance.
    * [Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) pricing is consumption-based rather than based on number of seats used. Seat management only applies to the Models product.
* You can now configure [access roles at the project level for team and restricted scoped projects](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/restricted-projects/). It allows assigning different access roles to a user within different projects in the same team, and thus adding another strong control to conform to enterprise governance needs.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where underlying database schema changes as part of release upgrades could timeout during platform startup time.
* Added more performance improvements to the underlying parquet store service, to further improve the chart loading times for users. Parquet store service is only available on Dedicated Cloud, and Self-managed instances based on [W&B kubernetes operator](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/operator).
* Addressed the high CPU utilization issue for the underlying parquet store service, to make the efficient chart loading more reliable for users. Parquet store service is only available on Dedicated Cloud, and Self-managed instances based on [W&B kubernetes operator](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/operator).

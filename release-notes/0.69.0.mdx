W&B 0.69 focuses on making the workspace more intuitive, collaborative, and efficient. Clearer visualizations and faster artifact downloads streamline how you interact with your data, so you can gain and share insights more quickly. Updates to W&B Weave improve team workflows and evaluation tracking. A range of quality-of-life fixes tidy up the overall user experience.

This release also marks the end of life for v0.54 and older, which are now officially unsupported.


The latest patch is **v0.69.1**.{/* more */} Refer to [Patches](#patches).

## Upgrading
To [upgrade](/guides/hosting/server-upgrade-process/#update-with-helm) to W&B v0.69.x, you must use v0.31.4+ of the `operator-wandb` Helm chart. Otherwise, after the upgrade, the `weave-cache-clear` container can fail to start. Ensure that your deployment uses these values:

```yaml
chart:
  url: https://charts.wandb.ai
  name: operator-wandb
  version: 0.31.4
```

If you have questions or are experiencing issues with an upgrade, contact [support](mailto:support@wandb.com).

## Features
- You can now set a custom display name for a run directly in the workspace. Customized run names show up in all plots and tables but only in your workspace, with no impact on your teammates’ views. This provides a clearer and cleaner view in your workspace, with no more labels like `*...v6-final-restart...`* in every legend and plot.
- When filtering or grouping runs, colors can sometimes overlap and become indistinct. The run selector’s new **Randomize Colors** option reassigns random colors from the default palette to your current run selection or groups, helping to make the colors more distinguishable.
- In line plots, you can now use **Cmd+Click** on a line to open a single-run view in a new tab.
- Video media panels now provide more playback controls to play, pause, seek, view full screen, and adjust playback speed.
- Settings for all types of media panels have been reorganized and improved.
- You can now customize the point and background colors for point cloud panels.
- Team-level and organization-level service accounts can now interact with Registry.
- Improved Exponentially-weighted Moving Average (EMA) smoothing provides more reliable [smoothed lines](/guides/app/features/panels/line-plot/smoothing/) when operating on complete, unbinned data. In most cases, smoothing is handled at the back end for improved performance. This feature was in private preview in v0.68.x.

### Private preview
Private preview features are available by invitation only. To request enrollment in a private preview, contact [support](mailto:support@wandb.com) or your AISE.

- You can now color all of your runs based on a secondary metric, such as loss or custom efficiency metrics. This creates a clear gradient color scale across your runs in all plots, so you can spot patterns faster. [Watch a video demo](https://www.loom.com/share/c6ed484899324de991ef7147fd73785d).
- [Personal workspace templates](/guides/track/workspaces/#workspace-templates){/* TODO change to a relref after workspace templates docs merge */} allow you to save core line plot settings and automatically reapply them in new views. These settings include x-axis key, smoothing algorithm, smoothing factor, max number of lines, whether to use the run selector’s grouping, and which aggregation to apply.

### Weave
- [Saved views](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/saved-views/) simplify team collaboration and allow you to persist filter and column settings.
- PDFs and generic files are now supported.
- The new [`EvaluationLogger` API](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/evaluation/evaluation_logger) provides flexible imperative-style evaluation logging.
- You can now import [human annotations](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/feedback#add-human-annotations) into Weave datasets
- [Playground](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/playground/) now supports saved configurations and prompts.
- Decorators are now supported in TypeScript.
- Added support for [tracing generator functions](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/tracing#trace-sync--async-generator-functions).
- The new [`dataset.add_rows`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/reference/python-sdk/weave/#method-add_rows) helper improves the efficiency of appending to an existing dataset.
- To help you understand your usage, trace and object sizes are now shown through the UI.

## Performance
- With [`wandb` SDK](/quickstart/#install-the-wandb-library-and-log-in) v0.19.11, artifacts now download 3-5x faster on average. For example, an artifact that previously downloaded at around 100 MB/sec may now download at 450 MB/sec or faster. Actual download speeds vary based on factors such as your network and storage infrastructure.
- Improved caching on [Project](/guides/track/project-page/) and [User Settings](/guides/app/settings-page/user-settings/) pages.

## Fixes
- Improved the startup process for the `weave-cache-clear` container to ensure compatibility with Python virtual environments.
- Added options for denser display of console logs.
- Workspace loading screens are now more informative.
- When adding a panel from a workspace to a report, the current project’s reports are now shown first in the destination report list.
- Fixed many cases where y-axes would over-round to a degree that caused duplicate values to display.
- Fixed confusing behavior when entering invalid smoothing parameters.
- Removed the **Partial Media** warning from media panels. This does not change the behavior of the media panels.
- When adding a [run filter based on tags](/guides/runs/filter-runs/#filter-runs-with-tags), the filter is now selected by default, as when filtering by other fields.
- Removed the green bell icon that could appear on active runs in the run selector.
- Removed the System page for individual runs.
- The project description field now respects new lines.
- Fixed URLs for legacy model registry collections.
- Fixed a bug where the Netron viewer did not expand to fill all available space on the page.
- When you click **Delete** on a project, the project name now displays in the confirmation modal.

## Patches
### 0.69.1
**June 10, 2025**


- You can now set the initial run state when creating a run with `Run.create()` by setting the `state` parameter to `pending` or `running`.

### Upcoming changes
- We’re optimizing our rendering behavior in the workspace to provide faster loading in workspaces with many panels, as well as more responsive and accurate drag-and-drop of panels in workspaces. **As part of this, we plan to remove the “Custom grid” layout in workspace sections in the next (0.73) release.** Custom grids will remain available in Reports. Reach out to your W&B team or [support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) for any questions or concerns.
- In an upcoming release, we will align multi-run and single-run workspace views, so when you drill into a single run, you’ll see the same layout and configuration of panels as you’ve configured for the multi-run view, including any custom charts, layouts, and settings. The goal is help you stay in context and avoid re-work around configuring your views. However, this will remove the ability to customize unique single-run views, isolated from the rest of the workspace. Reach out to your W&B team or [support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) for any questions about the migration.
- Over the next several releases, we will continue migrating existing team-level Model Registry to W&B Registry.

## Fixes
- Reverted the line plot behavior change announced in 0.71.0. Line plots with only 1 point for every line will convert to bar charts even if settings are changed.
- Fixed a bug that could cause bounding boxes to render outside the media in a media panel instead of overlaying the media.
- Fixed a bug where the Google Agent Development Kit integration did not support Weave Threads.
- Fixed a bug where the **Attributes** column was missing from Weave traces submitted through OpenTelemetry.

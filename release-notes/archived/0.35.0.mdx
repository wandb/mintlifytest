## Security

Fixed issue where API keys were logged for recently logged in users. Check for `FetchAuthUserByAPIKey` in the logs which you can find in `gorilla.log` from a debug bundle and rotate any keys that are found.

[W&B Launch](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch) allows you to push machine learning jobs to a wide range of specialized compute environments.  With this update, you can now use W&B to monitor and debug jobs running in these remote environments, without needing to log into your AWS or GCP console.

## Fixes

- Logs tab is no longer trimmed to 1000 rows.
- Fixed scenario where artifact files pagination could get into an infinite loop
- Fixed bug where success toast messages were not appearing
- The Runs table will now correctly show the git commit value

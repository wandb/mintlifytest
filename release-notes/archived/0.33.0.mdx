Control your model promotion process with a new role for model registry admins.   These users can manage the list of protected aliases (for example, “challenger” or “prod”), as well as apply or remove protected aliases for model versions.

### Viewer role

You can now share your W&B findings with a broader audience with the introduction of a Viewer role for W&B Server.  Users with this role can view anything their team(s) make, but not create, edit, or delete anything.   These seats are measured separately from traditional W&B Server seats, so reach out your W&B account team to request an updated license.

### Improved sharing: optional magic link, and easier signup for viewers

Team admins can now disable magic link sharing for a team and its members.  Disable public sharing on the team setting allows you increase team privacy controls.  Meanwhile, it’s now easier for users who receive a report link to access the report in W&B after signing up.

### Improved report composition

Reports help share your findings W&B further throughout an organization, including with people outside the ML team. We’ve made several investments to ensure it’s as simple and frictionless as possible to create and share them—including an improved report drafting experience with enhanced draft publication, editing, management, and sharing UX to improve how teams collaborate with Reports. 

### Updated navigation

As W&B has expanded the parts of the ML workflow we cover, we’ve heard your feedback that it can be hard to move around the application.   So we’ve updated the navigation sidebar to include clearer labels on the product area, and added backlinks to certain detail screens.   We’ve also renamed “Triggers” to “Automations” to better reflect the power of the feature.

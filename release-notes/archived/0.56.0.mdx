## Features

**The new Full Fidelity line plot in W&B Experiments enhances the visibility of training metrics by aggregating all data along the x-axis, displaying the minimum, maximum, and average values within each bucket, allowing users to easily spot outliers and zoom into high-fidelity details without downsampling loss.**  [Learn more in our documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/features/panels/line-plot/sampling).

<Note>
Due to a release versioning issue, 0.56.0 is the next major release after 0.54.0. The 0.55.0 was a patch release for 0.54.0.
</Note>

The 0.56.0 release also includes these capabilities: {/* more */}
* You can now use [cross-cloud storage buckets for team-level BYOB (secure storage connector)](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector#cross-cloud-or-s3-compatible-storage-for-team-level-byob) in Dedicated Cloud and Self-managed instances. For example, in a W&B instance on AWS, you can now configure Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage for team-level BYOB, and so on for each cross-cloud combination. 
* In the same vein, you can now use [S3-compatible storage buckets like MinIO for team-level BYOB (secure storage connector)](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector#cross-cloud-or-s3-compatible-storage-for-team-level-byob) in Dedicated Cloud and Self-managed instances. For example, in a W&B instance on GCP, you can configure a MinIO bucket hosted in cloud or on-prem for team-level BYOB.
* Admins can now automate full deletion of users in their Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed instances using the [SCIM API's DELETE User endpoint](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/scim#delete-user). The user deactivation operation has been reimplemented using the [PATCH User endpoint](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/scim#deactivate-user), along with the introduction of [user reactivation operation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/iam/scim#reactivate-user).
* If you use the SCIM API, you will also see a couple of minor improvements:
    * The API now has a more pertinent error message in case of authentication failures.
    * Relevant endpoints now return the full name of a user in the SCIM User object if it's available.

## Fixes

* The fix resolves an issue where deleting a search term from a runset in a report could delete the panel or cause the report to crash by ensuring proper handling of selected text during copy/paste operations.
* The fix addresses a problem with indenting bulleted items in reports, which was caused by an upgrade of slate and an additional check in the normalization process for elements.
* The fix resolves an issue where text could not be selected from a panel when the report was in edit mode.
* The fix addresses an issue where copy-pasting an entire panel grid in a Report using command-c was broken.
* The fix resolves an issue where report sharing with a magic link was broken when a team had the `Hide this team from all non-members` setting enabled.
* The fix introduces proper handling for restricted projects by allowing only explicitly invited users to access them, and implementing permissions based on project members and team roles.
* The fix allows instance admins to write to their own named workspaces, read other personal and shared workspaces, and write to shared views in private and public projects.
* The fix resolves an issue where the report would crash when trying to edit filters due to an out-of-bounds filter index caused by skipping non-individual filters while keeping the index count incremental.
* The fix addresses an issue where unselecting a runset caused media panels to crash in a report by ensuring only runs in enabled runsets are returned.
* The fix resolves an issue where the parameter importance panel crashes on initial load due to a violation of hooks error caused by a change in the order of hooks.
* The fix prevents chart data from being reloaded when scrolling down and then back up in small workspaces, enhancing performance and eliminating the feeling of slowness.

W&B v0.74 delivers SCIM API improvements for enterprise identity management, including automated group sync with Okta, streamlined user role configuration, and more. In Dedicated Cloud, a powerful new full-screen image browser helps you inspect and compare images within and between runs. Weave enhancements include in-Playground LLM judge evaluations, better visibility into multi-turn Thread tool calls, DSPy improvements, and a new integration with the Verifiers library for Reinforcement Learning workflows. W&B Inference adds support for the [Z.AI](https://z.ai/) GLM v4.5 hybrid reasoning model.

The latest patch is **v0.74.1**. Refer to [Patches](#patches).

## Support and end of life
- W&B Server v0.60 and below reached end of life on October 2, 2025.
- W&B Server v0.61 is scheduled to reach end of life on October 28, 2025.

<Note>
For more information about the W&B Server release schedule and support, see [W&B Server release policies](/release-notes/release-policies).
</Note>

## Features
- The SCIM API has been enhanced:
    - Provisioning and deprovisioning operations are now more compatible with Okta.
    - In Multi-tenant Cloud deployments, you can now configure the organization role and teams when you [create a user](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#create-user). This aligns with the endpoint's behavior in Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed.
    - In Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed deployments, you can now update a user's username or email address. See [Update user email](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#update-user-email) and [Update user display name](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#update-user-display-name). Not applicable to Multi-tenant Cloud deployments.
    - You can now [search and retrieve a user](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#get-user) by email and username.
    - Okta groups are now synced automatically using [ETags](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#etag-support). For details about SCIM groups, see [Group resource](/guides/hosting/iam/scim#group-resource).
- When [exporting the list of users](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/org-dashboard#export-user-details) in your organization, the CSV file now includes columns for **Models seats** and **Weave access**.
- In **W&B Dedicated Cloud**, the new full-screen image browser simplifies inspection and comparison of logged images.
    - **True full-screen view.** Inspect image details more easily with edge-to-edge full-screen viewing. No more cramped panels.
    - **Step slider in full-screen view.** Move through steps efficiently with an embedded slider to see how outputs evolve.
    - **Quickly toggle between runs using the keyboard.** In full-screen view, use the keyboard **left / right arrow** keys to move between runs, and use **Cmd + left / right arrow** (macOS) or **Ctrl + left / right arrow** (Windows / Linux) to move between steps of the same image.

### Weave
- From the **Evaluations** sidebar tab, you can now update prompt values and run LLM judge evaluations to test the changes. Try it out in the [Playground](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/playground/).
- You can now integrate Weave into your Reinforcement Learning (RL) training workflows and [view the traces and evaluations](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/weave-in-workspaces) captured during training in the W&B Workspace, together with run metrics panels.
- Weave now includes an integration with [Verifiers](https://verifiers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library of modular components for creating Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments and training LLM agents. Environments built with Verifiers can serve as LLM evaluations, synthetic data pipelines, agent harnesses for OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and RL training. [Learn more](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/verifiers).
- From the **Threads** sidebar tab, you can now view tool calls for a multi-turn Thread together with its message history.
- A Team's **Project** page now shows the number of Weave traces for each project together with data about the project's runs.
- The [DSPy integration](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/dspy) has been improved. For details, see [`wandb/weave` #5184](https://github.com/wandb/weave/pull/5184).
- If your Weave code calls `wandb.init()`, it no longer needs to explicitly call `weave.init()`.
- New convenience method [`delete_all_object_versions`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/reference/python-sdk/weave/trace/weave.trace.weave_client/).
- The output from an OpenAI streaming endpoint call now includes a new field, `time_to_first_token`, expressed in milliseconds.

### Inference
- [W&B Inference](/inference) adds support for the [Z.AI GLM](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) hybrid reasoning model. v4.5 is supported.

## Fixes
- Fixed display problems in bounding boxes with captions.
- When grouping runs in the Runs Table, you can now expand the `null` group to see the runs with null values for the grouping key.
- Increased running average smoothing parameter maximum to **1000**.
- Fixed a bug where clicking a run name could open an invalid URL if a runset included runs from multiple projects.
- Fixed text display issues in dark mode.
- Fixed a permission bug when viewing a public report that included Query Panels.
- Fixed a UI bug that could prevent code from being copied from a report.
- Fixed a bug in the order of min and max values in a line plot tooltip.
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a grouped plot from rendering if the X-axis key was a substring of the Y-axis key.

## Patches
### v0.74.1
**October 8, 2025**

- Fixed a bug that could prevent an organization admin from accessing the Organization Dashboard.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.73.0 that allowed deletion of previously exported Parquet files.
- Fixed a bug that could allow deleting an artifact file in Parquet after it has successfully committed.
- Fixed a performance regression introduced in v0.73 when querying system metrics from MySQL.
- Fixed a bug that could prevent editing of a project with no owner.
- Historical metric histograms no longer display in summary pages by default. Instead, details about each metric display in summary pages, and histograms are available as workspace panels.

Define the scope of a W&B project to limit who can view, edit, and submit W&B runs to it. 

You can use a combination of a couple of controls to configure the access level for any project within a W&B team. **Visibility scope** is the higher-level mechanism. Use that to control which groups of users can view or submit runs in a project. For a project with _Team_ or _Restricted_ visibility scope, you can then use **Project level roles** to control the level of access that each user has within the project.

<Note>
The owner of a project, a team admin, or an organization admin can set or edit a project's visibility.
</Note>

## Visibility scopes

There are four project visibility scopes you can choose from. In order of most public to most private, they are: 


| Scope | Description | 
| ----- | ----- |
| Open |Anyone who knows about the project can view it and submit runs or reports.|
| Public |Anyone who knows about the project can view it. Only your team can submit runs or reports.|
| Team | Only members of the parent team can view the project and submit runs or reports. Anyone outside the team can not access the project. |
| Restricted| Only invited members from the parent team can view the project and submit runs or reports.|


<Note>
Set a project's scope to **Restricted** if you would like to collaborate on workflows related to sensitive or confidential data. When you create a restricted project within a team, you can invite or add specific members from the team to collaborate on relevant experiments, artifacts, reports, and so forth. 

Unlike other project scopes, all members of a team do not get implicit access to a restricted project. At the same time, team admins can join restricted projects if needed.
</Note>

### Set visibility scope on a new or existing project

Set a project's visibility scope when you create a project or when editing it later.

<Note>
* Only the owner of the project or a team admin can set or edit its visibility scope.
* When a team admin enables **Make all future team projects private (public sharing not allowed)** within a team's privacy setting, that turns off **Open** and **Public** project visibility scopes for that team. In this case, your team can only use **Team** and **Restricted** scopes.
</Note>

#### Set visibility scope when you create a new project

1. Navigate to your W&B organization on SaaS Cloud, Dedicated Cloud, or Self-managed instance.
2. Click the **Create a new project** button in the left hand sidebar's **My projects** section. Alternatively, navigate to the **Projects** tab of your team and click the **Create new project** button in the upper right hand corner.
3. After selecting the parent team and entering the name of the project, select the desired scope from the **Project Visibility** dropdown.

Complete the following step if you select **Restricted** visibility. 

4. Provide names of one or more W&B team members in the **Invite team members** field. Add only those members who are essential to collaborate on the project.

<Note>
You can add or remove members in a restricted project later, from its **Users** tab.
</Note>

#### Edit visibility scope of an existing project

1. Navigate to your W&B Project.
2. Select the **Overview** tab on the left column.
3. Click the **Edit Project Details** button on the upper right corner.  
4. From the **Project Visibility** dropdown, select the desired scope.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/hosting/restricted_project_edit.gif" alt="Editing restricted project settings"  />
</Frame>

Complete the following step if you select **Restricted** visibility. 

5. Go to the **Users** tab in the project, and click **Add user** button to invite specific users to the restricted project.

<Warning>
* All members of a team lose access to a project if you change its visibility scope from **Team** to **Restricted**, unless you invite the required team members to the project.
* All members of a team get access to a project if you change its visibility scope from **Restricted** to **Team**.
* If you remove a team member from the user list for a restricted project, they lose access to that project.
</Warning>

### Other key things to note for restricted scope

* If you want to use a team-level service account in a restricted project, you should invite or add that specifically to the project. Otherwise a team-level service account can not access a restricted project by default.
* You can not move runs from a restricted project, but you can move runs from a non-restricted project to a restricted one.
* You can convert the visibility of a restricted project to only **Team** scope, irrespective of the team privacy setting **Make all future team projects private (public sharing not allowed)**.
* If the owner of a restricted project is not part of the parent team anymore, the team admin should change the owner to ensure seamless operations in the project.

## Project level roles

For the _Team_ or _Restricted_ scoped projects in your team, you can assign a specific role to a user, which could be different from that user's team level role. For example, if a user has _Member_ role at the team level, you can assign the _View-Only_, or _Admin_, or any available custom role to that user within a _Team_ or _Restricted_ scope project in that team.

<Note>
Project level roles are in preview on SaaS Cloud, Dedicated Cloud, and Self-managed instances.
</Note>

### Assign project level role to a user

1. Navigate to your W&B Project.
2. Select the **Overview** tab on the left column.
3. Go to the **Users** tab in the project.
4. Click the currently assigned role for the pertinent user in the **Project Role** field, which should open up a dropdown listing the other available roles.
5. Select another role from the dropdown. It should save instantly.

<Note>
When you change the project level role for a user to be different from their team level role, the project level role includes a **\*** to indicate the difference.
</Note>

### Other key things to note for project level roles

* By default, project level roles for all users in a _team_ or _restricted_ scoped project **inherit** their respective team level roles.
* You **can not** change the project level role of a user who has _View-only_ role at the team level.
* If the project level role for a user within a particular project **is same as** the team level role, and at some point if a team admin changes the team level role, the relevant project role is automatically changed to track the team level role.
* If you change the project level role for a user within a particular project such that **it is different from** the team level role, and at some point if a team admin changes the team level role, the relevant project level role remains as is.
* If you remove a user from a _restricted_ project when their project level role was different from the team level role, and if you then add the user back to the project after some time, they would inherit the team level role due to the default behavior. If needed, you would need to change the project level role again to be different from the team level role.

This section provides details to help you use the W&B App UI. Manage workspaces, teams, and registries, visualize and observe experiments, create panels and reports, configure automations, and more.

Access the W&B App in a web browser. 

- A W&B Multi-tenant deployment is accessible on the public web at https://wandb.ai/.

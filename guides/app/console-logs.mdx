When you run an experiment, you may notice various messages printed to your console. W&B captures console logs and displays them in the W&B App. Use these messages to debug and monitor the behavior of your experiment.

## View console logs

Access console logs for a run in the W&B App:

1. Navigate to your project in the W&B App.
2. Select a run within the **Runs** table.
3. Click the **Logs** tab in the project sidebar.

<Note>
Only 10,000 lines of your logs are shown due to storage limitations
</Note>

{/* ## Console log fields

Within the W&B App you can modify the fields shown in the console logs table. */}

## Types of console logs

W&B captures several types of console logs: informational messages, warnings, and errors, with a prefix to indicate the log's severity.

### Informational messages
Informational messages provide updates about the run's progress and status. They are typically prefixed with `wandb:`.

```text
wandb: Starting Run: abc123
wandb: Run data is saved locally in ./wandb/run-20240125_120000-abc123
```

### Warning messages
Warnings about potential issues that don't stop execution are prefixed with `WARNING:`

```text
WARNING Found .wandb file, not streaming tensorboard metrics.
WARNING These runs were logged with a previous version of wandb.
```

### Error messages 
Error messages for serious issues are prefixed with `ERROR:`. These indicate problems that may prevent the run from completing successfully.

```text
ERROR Unable to save notebook session history.
ERROR Failed to save notebook.
```

## Console log settings

Within your code, pass the `wandb.Settings` object to `wandb.init()` to configure how W&B handles console logs. Within `wandb.Settings`, you can set the following parameters to control console log behavior:

- `show_errors`: If set to `True`, error messages are displayed in the W&B App. If set to `False`, error messages are not shown.
- `silent`: If set to `True`, all W&B console output will be suppressed. This is useful for production environments where you want to minimize console noise.
- `show_warnings`: If set to `True`, warning messages are displayed in the W&B App. If set to `False`, warning messages are not shown.
- `show_info`: If set to `True`, informational messages are displayed in the W&B App. If set to `False`, informational messages are not shown.

The following example shows how to configure these settings:

```python
import wandb

settings = wandb.Settings(
    show_errors=True,  # Show error messages in the W&B App
    silent=False,      # Disable all W&B console output
    show_warnings=True # Show warning messages in the W&B App
)

with wandb.init(settings=settings) as run:
    # Your training code here
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.95})
```

## Custom logging

W&B captures console logs from your application, but it does not interfere with your own logging setup. You can use Python's built-in `print()` function or the `logging` module to log messages.

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(project="my-project") as run:
    for i in range(100, 1000, 100):
        # This will log to W&B and print to console
        run.log({"epoch": i, "loss": 0.1 * i})
        print(f"epoch: {i} loss: {0.1 * i}")
```

The console logs will look similar to the following:

```text
1 epoch:  100 loss: 1.3191105127334595
2 epoch:  200 loss: 0.8664389848709106
3 epoch:  300 loss: 0.6157898902893066
4 epoch:  400 loss: 0.4961796700954437
5 epoch:  500 loss: 0.42592573165893555
6 epoch:  600 loss: 0.3771176040172577
7 epoch:  700 loss: 0.3393910825252533
8 epoch:  800 loss: 0.3082585036754608
9 epoch:  900 loss: 0.28154927492141724
```

## Time stamps

Time stamps are automatically added to each console log entry. This allows you to track when each log message was generated.

You can toggle the time stamps in the console logs on or off. Within the console page select the **Timestamp visible** dropdown in the top left corner. You can choose to show or hide the time stamps.

## Search console logs

Use the search bar at the top of the console logs page to filter logs by keywords. You can search for specific terms, labels, or error messages.

## Filter with custom labels

<Warning>
Parameters prefixed by `x_` (such as `x_label`) are in public preview. Create a [GitHub issue in the W&B repository](https://github.com/wandb/wandb) to provide feedback.
</Warning>

You can filter console logs based on the labels you pass as arguments for `x_label` in `wandb.Settings` in the UI search bar located at the top of the console log page. 

```python
import wandb

# Initialize a run in the primary node
run = wandb.init(
    entity="entity",
    project="project",
	settings=wandb.Settings(
        x_label="custom_label"  # (Optional) Custom label for filtering logs
        )
)
```

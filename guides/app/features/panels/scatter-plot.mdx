This page shows how to use scatter plots in W&B.

## Use case 

Use scatter plots to compare multiple runs and visualize the performance of an experiment:

- Plot lines for minimum, maximum, and average values.
- Customize metadata tooltips.
- Control point colors.
- Adjust axis ranges.
- Use a log scale for the axes.

## Example

The following example shows a scatter plot displaying validation accuracy for different models over several weeks of experimentation. The tooltip includes batch size, dropout, and axis values. A line also shows the running average of validation accuracy.

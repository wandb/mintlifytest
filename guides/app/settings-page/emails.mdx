## Log in methods

The Log in Methods column displays the log in methods that are associated with your account.

A verification email is sent to your email account when you create a W&B account. Your email account is considered unverified until you verify your email address. Unverified emails are displayed in red.

Attempt to log in with your email address again to retrieve a second verification email if you no longer have the original verification email that was sent to your email account.

Contact support@wandb.com for account log in issues.

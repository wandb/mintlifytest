W&B Weave is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications. Designed for flexibility and scalability, Weave supports every stage of your LLM application development workflow:

- **Tracing & Monitoring**: Track LLM calls and application logic to debug and analyze production systems.
- **Systematic Iteration**: Refine and iterate on prompts, datasets and models.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different models and prompts in the LLM Playground. 
- **Evaluation**: Use custom or pre-built scorers alongside our comparison tools to systematically assess and enhance application performance.
- **Guardrails**: Protect your application with safeguards for content moderation, prompt safety, and more.

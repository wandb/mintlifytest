[Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) is a PyTorch framework for deep learning R&D that focuses on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse so you can create something new.

Catalyst includes a W&B integration for logging parameters, metrics, images, and other artifacts.

Check out their [documentation of the integration](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/api/loggers.html#catalyst.loggers.wandb.WandbLogger), which includes examples using Python and Hydra.

## Interactive Example

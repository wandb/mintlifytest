DeepChecks helps you validate your machine learning models and data, such as verifying your dataâ€™s integrity, inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model and comparing between different models, all with minimal effort.

[Read more about DeepChecks and the wandb integration ->](https://docs.deepchecks.com/stable/general/usage/exporting_results/auto_examples/plot_exports_output_to_wandb.html)

## Getting Started

To use DeepChecks with W&B you will first need to sign up for a [W&B account](https://wandb.ai/site). With the W&B integration in DeepChecks you can quickly get started like so:

```python
import wandb

wandb.login()

# import your check from deepchecks
from deepchecks.checks import ModelErrorAnalysis

# run your check
result = ModelErrorAnalysis()

# push that result to wandb
result.to_wandb()
```

You can also log an entire DeepChecks test suite to W&B.

```python
import wandb

wandb.login()

# import your full_suite tests from deepchecks
from deepchecks.suites import full_suite

# create and run a DeepChecks test suite
suite_result = full_suite().run(...)

# push thes results to wandb
# here you can pass any wandb.init configs and arguments you need
suite_result.to_wandb(project="my-suite-project", config={"suite-name": "full-suite"})
```

## Example

[This Report](https://wandb.ai/cayush/deepchecks/reports/Validate-your-Data-and-Models-with-Deepchecks-and-W-B--VmlldzoxNjY0ODc5) shows off the power of using DeepChecks and W&B.

"The team that has been maintaining Gym since 2021 has moved all future development to [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), a drop in replacement for Gym (import gymnasium as gym), and Gym will not be receiving any future updates."

Since Gym is no longer an actively maintained project, try out our integration with Gymnasium.

If you're using [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), W&B automatically logs videos of your environment generated by `gym.wrappers.Monitor`. Just set the `monitor_gym` keyword argument to [`wandb.init`](/ref/python/functions/init) to `True` or call `wandb.gym.monitor()`.

Our gym integration is very light. We simply [look at the name of the video file](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/master/wandb/integration/gym/__init__.py#L15) being logged from `gym` and name it after that or fall back to `"videos"` if we don't find a match. If you want more control, you can always just manually [log a video](/guides/models/track/log/media).

The [OpenRL Benchmark](https://wandb.me/openrl-benchmark-report) by[ CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) uses this integration for its OpenAI Gym examples. You can find source code (including [the specific code used for specific runs](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/2jrqfugg/code?workspace=user-costa-huang)) that demonstrates how to use gym with

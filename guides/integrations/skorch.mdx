You can use W&B with Skorch to automatically log the model with the best performance, along with all model performance metrics, the model topology and compute resources after each epoch. Every file saved in `wandb_run.dir` is automatically logged to W&B.

See [example run](https://app.wandb.ai/borisd13/skorch/runs/s20or4ct?workspace=user-borisd13).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `wandb_run` | `wandb.wandb_run`. Run | wandb run used to log data. |
|`save_model` | bool (default=True)| Whether to save a checkpoint of the best model and upload it to your Run on W&B.|
|`keys_ignored`| str or list of str (default=None) | Key or list of keys that should not be logged to tensorboard. Note that in addition to the keys provided by the user, keys such as those starting with `event_` or ending on `_best` are ignored by default.|

## Example Code

We've created a few examples for you to see how the integration works:

```python
# Install wandb
... pip install wandb

import wandb
from skorch.callbacks import WandbLogger

# Create a wandb Run
wandb_run = wandb.init()
# Alternative: Create a wandb Run without a W&B account
wandb_run = wandb.init(anonymous="allow")

# Log hyper-parameters (optional)
wandb_run.config.update({"learning rate": 1e-3, "batch size": 32})

net = NeuralNet(..., callbacks=[WandbLogger(wandb_run)])
net.fit(X, y)
```

| `on_batch_end`\(net\[, X, y, training\]\) | Called at the end of each batch. |
| `on_epoch_begin`\(net\[, dataset_train, …\]\) | Called at the beginning of each epoch. |
| `on_epoch_end`\(net, \*\*kwargs\) | Log values from the last history step and save best model |
| `on_grad_computed`\(net, named_parameters\[, X, …\]\) | Called once per batch after gradients have been computed but before an update step was performed. |
| `on_train_begin`\(net, \*\*kwargs\) | Log model topology and add a hook for gradients |
| `on_train_end`\(net\[, X, y\]\) | Called at the end of training. |

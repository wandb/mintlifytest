[Ultralytics' YOLOv5](https://ultralytics.com/yolo) ("You Only Look Once") model family enables real-time object detection with convolutional neural networks without all the agonizing pain.

[W&B](https://wandb.com) is directly integrated into YOLOv5, providing experiment metric tracking, model and dataset versioning, rich model prediction visualization, and more. **It's as easy as running a single `pip install` before you run your YOLO experiments.**

<Note>
All W&B logging features are compatible with data-parallel multi-GPU training, such as with [PyTorch DDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).
</Note>

## Track core experiments
Simply by installing `wandb`, you'll activate the built-in W&B [logging features](/guides/models/track/log/): system metrics, model metrics, and media logged to interactive [Dashboards](/guides/models/track/workspaces).

```python
pip install wandb
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
python yolov5/train.py  # train a small network on a small dataset
```

Just follow the links printed to the standard out by wandb.

## Customize the integration

By passing a few simple command line arguments to YOLO, you can take advantage of even more W&B features.

* If you pass a number to `--save_period`, W&B saves a [model version](/guides/core/registry/) at the end of every `save_period` epochs. The model version includes the model weights and tags the best-performing model in the validation set.
* Turning on the `--upload_dataset` flag will also upload the dataset for data versioning.
* Passing a number to `--bbox_interval` will turn on [data visualization](../). At the end of every `bbox_interval` epochs, the outputs of the model on the validation set will be uploaded to W&B.

<Note>
Every W&B account comes with 100 GB of free storage for datasets and models.

Here's what that looks like.

<Note>
With data and model versioning, you can resume paused or crashed experiments from any device, no setup necessary. Check out [the Colab ](https://wandb.me/yolo-colab) for details.

<Note>
W&B support embedded TensorBoard for W&B Multi-tenant SaaS.
</Note>

Upload your TensorBoard logs to the cloud, quickly share your results among colleagues and classmates and keep your analysis in one centralized location.

## Get started

```python
import wandb

# Start a wandb run with `sync_tensorboard=True`
wandb.init(project="my-project", sync_tensorboard=True) as run:
  # Your training code using TensorBoard
  ...

```

Review an [example TensorBoard integration run](https://wandb.ai/rymc/simple-tensorboard-example/runs/oab614zf/tensorboard).

Once your run finishes, you can access your TensorBoard event files in W&B and you can visualize your metrics in native W&B charts, together with additional useful information like the system's CPU or GPU utilization, the `git` state, the terminal command the run used, and more.

<Note>
W&B supports TensorBoard with all versions of TensorFlow. W&B also supports TensorBoard 1.14 and higher with PyTorch as well as TensorBoardX.

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I log metrics to W&B that aren't logged to TensorBoard?

If you need to log additional custom metrics that aren't being logged to TensorBoard, you can call `wandb.Run.log()` in your code `run.log({"custom": 0.8})`

Setting the step argument in `run.log()` is turned off when syncing Tensorboard. If you'd like to set a different step count, you can log the metrics with a step metric as:

`run.log({"custom": 0.8, "global_step": global_step})`

### How do I configure Tensorboard when I'm using it with `wandb`?

If you want more control over how TensorBoard is patched you can call `wandb.tensorboard.patch` instead of passing `sync_tensorboard=True` to `wandb.init`.

```python
import wandb

wandb.tensorboard.patch(root_logdir="<logging_directory>")
run = wandb.init()

# Finish the wandb run to upload the tensorboard logs to W&B (if running in Notebook)
run.finish()
```

You can pass `tensorboard_x=False` to this method to ensure vanilla TensorBoard is patched, if you're using TensorBoard > 1.14 with PyTorch you can pass `pytorch=True` to ensure it's patched. Both of these options have smart defaults depending on what versions of these libraries have been imported.

By default, we also sync the `tfevents` files and any `.pbtxt` files. This enables us to launch a TensorBoard instance on your behalf. You will see a [TensorBoard tab](https://www.wandb.com/articles/hosted-tensorboard) on the run page. This behavior can be turned off by passing `save=False` to `wandb.tensorboard.patch`

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
wandb.tensorboard.patch(save=False, tensorboard_x=True)

# If running in a notebook, finish the wandb run to upload the tensorboard logs to W&B
run.finish()
```

<Warning>
You must call either `wandb.init()` or `wandb.tensorboard.patch` **before** calling `tf.summary.create_file_writer` or constructing a `SummaryWriter` via `torch.utils.tensorboard`.
</Warning>

### How do I sync historical TensorBoard runs?

If you have existing `tfevents` files stored locally and you would like to import them into W&B, you can run `wandb sync log_dir`, where `log_dir` is a local directory containing the `tfevents` files.

### How do I use Google Colab or Jupyter with TensorBoard?

If running your code in a Jupyter or Colab notebook, make sure to call `wandb.Run.finish()` and the end of your training. This will finish the wandb run and upload the tensorboard logs to W&B so they can be visualized. This is not necessary when running a `.py` script as wandb finishes automatically when a script finishes.

To run shell commands in a notebook environment, you must prepend a `!`, as in `!wandb sync directoryname`.

### How do I use PyTorch with TensorBoard?

If you use PyTorch's TensorBoard integration, you may need to manually upload the PyTorch Profiler JSON file.

```python
with wandb.init(project="my-project", sync_tensorboard=True) as run:
    run.save(glob.glob(f"runs/*.pt.trace.json")[0], base_path=f"runs")
```

### Can I sync tfevents files stored in the cloud?

`wandb` 0.20.0 and above supports syncing `tfevents` files stored in S3, GCS or Azure. `wandb` uses the default credentials for each cloud provider, corresponding to the commands in the following table:

| Cloud provider | Credentials                             | Logging directory format              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| S3             | `aws configure`                         | `s3://bucket/path/to/logs`            |
| GCS            | `gcloud auth application-default login` | `gs://bucket/path/to/logs`            |
| Azure          | `az login`[^1]                          | `az://account/container/path/to/logs` |

[^1]: You must also set the `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` environment variables.

<Note>
Do you want to experiment with OpenAI models on Weave without any set up? Try the [LLM Playground](../tools/playground.mdx).
</Note>

## Tracing

It's important to store traces of LLM applications in a central database, both during development and in production. You'll use these traces for debugging and to help build a dataset of tricky examples to evaluate against while improving your application.

Weave can automatically capture traces for the [openai python library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/python-library).

Start capturing by calling `weave.init(<project-name>)` with a project name your choice.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave
client = OpenAI()
# highlight-next-line
weave.init('emoji-bot')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are AGI. You will be provided with a message, and your task is to respond using emojis only."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How are you?"
    }
  ]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { wrapOpenAI } from '@wandb/weave';

const openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());

// This will now trace all calls to OpenAI
openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are AGI. You will be provided with a message, and your task is to respond using emojis only."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "How are you?"
      }
    ]
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
We capture the function calling tools for [OpenAI Functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) as well.
</Tip>

## Structured Outputs

Weave also supports structured outputs with OpenAI. This is useful for ensuring that your LLM responses follow a specific format.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import weave

class UserDetail(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('extract-user-details')

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the user details from the message."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "My name is David and I am 30 years old."},
    ],
    response_format=UserDetail,
)

user_detail = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
print(user_detail)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Async Support

Weave also supports async functions for OpenAI.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import weave

client = AsyncOpenAI()
weave.init('async-emoji-bot')

async def call_openai():
    response = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": "You are AGI. You will be provided with a message, and your task is to respond using emojis only."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "How are you?"
            }
        ]
    )
    return response

# Call the async function
result = await call_openai()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Streaming Support

Weave also supports streaming responses from OpenAI.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('streaming-emoji-bot')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You are AGI. You will be provided with a message, and your task is to respond using emojis only."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How are you?"
        }
    ],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tracing Function Calls

Weave also traces function calls made by OpenAI when using tools.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('function-calling-bot')

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The location to get the weather for"
                    },
                    "unit": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                        "description": "The unit to return the temperature in"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather like in New York?"
        }
    ],
    tools=tools
)

print(response.choices[0].message.tool_calls)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Logging additional data

You can log additional data to your traces by using the `weave.log` function.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('logging-bot')

# Log additional data
weave.log({"user_id": "123", "session_id": "abc"})

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, how are you?"
        }
    ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Batch API

Weave also supports the OpenAI Batch API for processing multiple requests.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('batch-processing')

# Create a batch file
batch_input = [
    {
        "custom_id": "request-1",
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "/v1/chat/completions",
        "body": {
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
        }
    },
    {
        "custom_id": "request-2", 
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "/v1/chat/completions",
        "body": {
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like?"}]
        }
    }
]

# Submit the batch
batch = client.batches.create(
    input_file_id="your-file-id",
    endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
    completion_window="24h"
)

# Retrieve the batch results
completed_batch = client.batches.retrieve(batch.id)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Assistants API

Weave also supports the OpenAI Assistants API for building conversational AI applications.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('assistant-bot')

# Create an assistant
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="Math Assistant",
    instructions="You are a personal math tutor. Answer questions about math.",
    model="gpt-4"
)

# Create a thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# Add a message to the thread
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="What is 2+2?"
)

# Run the assistant
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id
)

# Get the assistant's response
messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Cost Tracking

Weave automatically tracks the cost of your OpenAI API calls. You can view the cost breakdown in the Weave UI.

<Note>
Cost tracking is available for all OpenAI models and is calculated based on the latest OpenAI pricing.
</Note>

## Tracing Custom Functions

You can also trace custom functions that use OpenAI by using the `@weave.op` decorator.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import weave

client = OpenAI()
weave.init('custom-function-bot')

@weave.op
def generate_response(prompt: str) -> str:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": prompt
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# This function call will be traced
result = generate_response("Hello, how are you?")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up tracing for OpenAI, you can:

1. **View traces in the Weave UI**: Go to your Weave project to see traces of your OpenAI calls
2. **Create evaluations**: Use your traces to build evaluation datasets
3. **Monitor performance**: Track latency, costs, and other metrics
4. **Debug issues**: Use traces to understand what's happening in your LLM application

For more information on these topics, check out our [evaluation guide](../evaluation/scorers.mdx) and [monitoring guide](../tracking/index.mdx).

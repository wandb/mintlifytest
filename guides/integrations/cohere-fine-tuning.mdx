With W&B you can log your Cohere model's fine-tuning metrics and configuration to analyze and understand the performance of your models and share the results with your colleagues.

This [guide from Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/page/convfinqa-finetuning-wandb) has a full example of how to kick off a fine-tuning run and you can find the [Cohere API docs here](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/createfinetunedmodel#request.body.settings.wandb)

## Log your Cohere fine-tuning results

To add Cohere fine-tuning logging to your W&B workspace:

1. Create a `WandbConfig` with your W&B API key, W&B `entity` and `project` name. You can find your W&B API key at https://wandb.ai/authorize

2. Pass this config to the `FinetunedModel` object along with your model name, dataset and hyperparameters to kick off your fine-tuning run.


    ```python
    from cohere.finetuning import WandbConfig, FinetunedModel

    # create a config with your W&B details
    wandb_ft_config = WandbConfig(
        api_key="<wandb_api_key>",
        entity="my-entity", # must be a valid enitity associated with the provided API key
        project="cohere-ft",
    )

    ...  # set up your datasets and hyperparameters

    # start a fine-tuning run on cohere
    cmd_r_finetune = co.finetuning.create_finetuned_model(
      request=FinetunedModel(
        name="command-r-ft",
        settings=Settings(
          base_model=...
          dataset_id=...
          hyperparameters=...
          wandb=wandb_ft_config  # pass your W&B config here
        ),
      ),
    )
    ```

3. View your model's fine-tuning training and validation metrics and hyperparameters in the W&B project that you created.

## Organize runs

Your W&B runs are automatically organized and can be filtered/sorted based on any configuration parameter such as job type, base model, learning rate and any other hyper-parameter.

In addition, you can rename your runs, add notes or create tags to group them.

This page shows how a Team admin or Registry admin can delete a custom registry.  A [core registry](/guides/core/registry/registry_types#core-registry) cannot be deleted.

- A Team admin can delete any custom registry in the organization.
- A Registry admin can delete a custom registry that they created.

Deleting a registry also deletes collections that belong to that registry, but does not delete artifacts linked to the registry.  Such an artifact remains in the original project that the artifact was logged to.

Use the `wandb` API's `delete()` method to delete a registry programmatically.  The following example illustrates how to:

1. Fetch the registry you want to delete with `api.registry()`.
1. Call the `delete()` method on the returned registry object to delete the registry.

```python
import wandb

# Initialize the W&B API
api = wandb.Api()

# Fetch the registry you want to delete
fetched_registry = api.registry("<registry_name>")

# Deleting a registry
fetched_registry.delete()
```

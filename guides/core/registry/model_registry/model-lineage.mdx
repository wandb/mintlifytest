This page describes creating lineage graphs in the legacy W&B Model Registry. To learn about lineage graphs in W&B Registry, refer to [Create and view lineage maps](../lineage).

<Note>
W&B will transition assets from the legacy [W&B Model Registry](/guides/core/registry/model_registry/) to the new [W&B Registry](./). This migration will be fully managed and triggered by W&B, requiring no intervention from users. The process is designed to be as seamless as possible, with minimal disruption to existing workflows. Refer to [Migrate from legacy Model Registry](../model_registry_eol).
</Note>


A useful feature of logging model artifacts to W&B are lineage graphs. Lineage graphs show artifacts logged by a run as well as artifacts used by specific run. 

This means that, when you log a model artifact, you at a minimum have access to view the W&B run that used or produced the model artifact. If you [track a dependency](#track-an-artifact-dependency), you also see the inputs used by the model artifact.

For example, the proceeding image shows artifacts created and used throughout an ML experiment:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/models/model_lineage_example.png" alt="Model lineage graph"  />
</Frame>

From left to right, the image shows:
1. The `jumping-monkey-1` W&B run created the `mnist_dataset:v0` dataset artifact.
2. The `vague-morning-5` W&B run trained a model using the `mnist_dataset:v0` dataset artifact. The output of this W&B run was a model artifact called `mnist_model:v0`.
3. A run called `serene-haze-6` used the model artifact (`mnist_model:v0`) to evaluate the model.


## Track an artifact dependency

Declare an dataset artifact as an input to a W&B run with the `use_artifact` API to track a dependency. 

The proceeding code snippet shows how to use the `use_artifact` API:

```python
# Initialize a run
run = wandb.init(project=project, entity=entity)

# Get artifact, mark it as a dependency
artifact = run.use_artifact(artifact_or_name="name", aliases="<alias>")
```

Once you have retrieved your artifact, you can use that artifact to (for example), evaluate the performance of a model.

--- title: "Deploy" description: "Deploy your Weave models to cloud platforms" --- ## Deploy to GCP <Note> `weave deploy` requires your machine to have `gcloud` installed and configured. `weave deploy gcp` will use pre-configured configuration when not directly specified by command line arguments. </Note> Given a Weave ref to any Weave Model you can run: ``` weave deploy gcp <ref> ``` to deploy a gcp cloud function that serves your model. The last line of the deployment will look like `Service URL: <PATH_TO_MODEL>`. Visit `<PATH_TO_MODEL>/docs` to interact with your model! Run ``` weave deploy gcp --help ``` to see all command line options.

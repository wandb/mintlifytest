Li, Lisha, et al. "[Hyperband: A novel bandit-based approach to hyperparameter optimization.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf)" _The   Journal of Machine Learning Research_ 18.1 (2017): 6765-6816.

### Sweep Experiments

The following W&B Reports demonstrate examples of projects that explore hyperparameter optimization with W&B Sweeps.

* [Drought Watch Benchmark Progress](https://wandb.ai/stacey/droughtwatch/reports/Drought-Watch-Benchmark-Progress--Vmlldzo3ODQ3OQ)

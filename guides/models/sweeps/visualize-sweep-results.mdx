Visualize the results of your W&B Sweeps with the W&B App. Navigate to the [W&B App](https://wandb.ai/home). Choose the project that you specified when you initialized a sweep. You will be redirected to your project [workspace](/guides/models/track/workspaces). Select the **Sweep icon** on the left panel (broom icon). From the Sweep UI, select the name of your Sweep from the list.

By default, W&B will automatically create a parallel coordinates plot, a parameter importance plot, and a scatter plot when you start a W&B Sweep job.

Parallel coordinates charts summarize the relationship between large numbers of hyperparameters and model metrics at a glance. For more information on parallel coordinates plots, see [Parallel coordinates](/guides/models/app/features/panels/parallel-coordinates).

The scatter plot(left) compares the W&B Runs that were generated during the Sweep. For more information about scatter plots, see [Scatter Plots](/guides/models/app/features/panels/scatter-plot).

The parameter importance plot(right) lists the hyperparameters that were the best predictors of, and highly correlated to desirable values of your metrics. For more information on parameter importance plots, see [Parameter Importance](/guides/models/app/features/panels/parameter-importance).

You can alter the dependent and independent values (x and y axis) that are automatically used. Within each panel there is a pencil icon called **Edit panel**. Choose **Edit panel**. A model will appear. Within the modal, you can alter the behavior of the graph.

For more information on all default W&B visualization options, see [Panels](/guides/models/app/features/panels/). See the [Data Visualization docs](/guides/models/tables/) for information on how to create plots from W&B Runs that are not part of a W&B Sweep.

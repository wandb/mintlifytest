Navigate to your user profile page and select your user icon on the top right corner. From the dropdown, choose **Settings**.

## Profile

Within the **Profile** section you can manage and modify your account name and institution. You can optionally add a biography, location, link to a personal or your institution’s website, and upload a profile image.

## Edit your intro

To edit your intro, click **Edit** at the top of your profile. The WYSIWYG editor that opens supports Markdown.
1. To edit a line, click it. To save time, you can type `/` and choose Markdown from the list.
1. Use an item's drag handles to move it.
1. To delete a block, click the drag handle, then click **Delete**.
1. To save your changes, click **Save**.

### Add social badges

To add a follow badge for the `@weights_biases` account on X, you could add a Markdown-style link with an HTML `<img>` tag that points to the badge image:

```markdown
[![X: @weights_biases](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/weights_biases?style=social)](https://x.com/intent/follow?screen_name=weights_biases)
```
In an `<img>` tag, you can specify `width`, `height`, or both. If you specify only one of them, the image's proportions are maintained.

## Default team
If you are a member of more than one team, the **Default team** section allows you to configure the default team to use when a run or a Weave trace does not specify a team. If you are a member of only one team, that team is the default and this section does not appear.

Select a tab to continue.

Use W&B Teams as a central workspace for your ML team to build better models faster.

* **Track all the experiments** your team has tried so you never duplicate work.
* **Save and reproduce** previously trained models.
* **Share progress** and results with your boss and collaborators.
* **Catch regressions** and immediately get alerted when performance drops.
* **Benchmark model performance** and compare model versions.

## Create a collaborative team

1. [Sign up or log in](https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true) to your free W&B account.
2. Click **Invite Team** in the navigation bar.
3. Create your team and invite collaborators.
4. To configure your team, refer to [Manage team settings](team-settings.md#privacy).

<Note>
**Note**: Only the admin of an organization can create a new team.
</Note>

## Create a team profile

You can customize your team's profile page to show an introduction and showcase reports and projects that are visible to the public or team members. Present reports, projects, and external links.

* **Highlight your best research** to visitors by showcasing your best public reports
* **Showcase the most active projects** to make it easier for teammates to find them
* **Find collaborators** by adding external links to your company or research lab's website and any papers you've published

{/* To do: show team profiles */}

{/* To do: show how to remove team members */}

## Remove team members

Team admins can open the team settings page and click the delete button next to the departing member's name. Any runs logged to the team remain after a user leaves.


## Manage team roles and permissions
Select a team role when you invite colleagues to join a team. There are following team role options:

- **Admin**: Team admins can add and remove other admins or team members. They have permissions to modify all projects and full deletion permissions. This includes, but is not limited to, deleting runs, projects, artifacts, and sweeps.
- **Member**: A regular member of the team. By default, only an admin can invite a team member. To change this behavior, refer to [Manage team settings](team-settings.md#privacy).
- **View-Only (Enterprise-only feature)**: View-Only members can view assets within the team such as runs, reports, and workspaces. They can follow and comment on reports, but they can not create, edit, or delete project overview, reports, or runs.
- **Custom roles (Enterprise-only feature)**: Custom roles allow organization admins to compose new roles based on either of the **View-Only** or **Member** roles, together with additional permissions to achieve fine-grained access control. Team admins can then assign any of those custom roles to users in their respective teams. Refer to [Introducing Custom Roles for W&B Teams](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/announcements/reports/Introducing-Custom-Roles-for-W-B-Teams--Vmlldzo2MTMxMjQ3) for details.

A team member can delete only runs they created. Suppose you have two members A and B. Member B moves a run from team B's project to a different project owned by Member A. Member A cannot delete the run Member B moved to Member A's project. An admin can manage runs and sweep runs created by any team member.

### Service accounts

In addition to user roles, teams can also use **service accounts** for automation. Service accounts are not users, but rather non-human identities used for automated workflows. Refer to [Use service accounts to automate workflows](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/service-accounts) for detailed information.

<Note>
W&B recommends assigning more than one admin in a team to ensure that admin operations can continue when the primary admin is not available.

### Team settings
Team settings allow you to manage the settings for your team and its members. With these privileges, you can effectively oversee and organize your team within W&B.

### System settings (W&B Server only)
Use system permissions to create and manage teams and their members and to adjust system settings. These privileges enable you to effectively administer and maintain the W&B instance.

| Permissions              | View-Only | Team Member | Team Admin | System Admin |

| Configure system settings|           |             |            | X            |
| Create/delete teams      |           |             |            | X            |

### Team service account behavior

* When you configure a team in your training environment, you can use a service account from that team to log runs in either of private or public projects within that team. Additionally, you can attribute those runs to a user if **WANDB_USERNAME** or **WANDB_USER_EMAIL** variable exists in your environment and the referenced user is part of that team.
* When you **do not** configure a team in your training environment and use a service account, the runs log to the named project within that service account's parent team. In this case as well, you can attribute the runs to a user if **WANDB_USERNAME** or **WANDB_USER_EMAIL** variable exists in your environment and the referenced user is part of the service account's parent team.
* A service account can not log runs to a private project in a team different from its parent team. A service account can log to runs to project only if the project is set to `Open` project visibility.

## Team trials

See the [pricing page](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing) for more information on W&B plans. You can download all your data at any time, either using the dashboard UI or the [Export API](/ref/python/public-api/index).

## Privacy settings

You can see the privacy settings of all team projects on the team settings page:
`app.wandb.ai/teams/your-team-name`

## Advanced configuration

### Secure storage connector

The team-level secure storage connector allows teams to use their own cloud storage bucket with W&B. This provides greater data access control and data isolation for teams with highly sensitive data or strict compliance requirements. Refer to [Secure Storage Connector](/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector) for more information.

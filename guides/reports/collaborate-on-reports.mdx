This page describes various ways to collaborate on reports with your team.

## Share a report
When viewing a report, click **Share**, then:
- To share a link to the report with an email address or a username, click **Invite**. Enter an email address or username, select **Can view** or **Can edit**, then click **Invite**. If you share by email, the email address does not need to be a member of your organization or team.
- To generate a sharing link instead, click **Share**. Adjust the permissions for the link, then click **Copy report link**. Share the link with the member.

When viewing the report, click a panel to open it in full-screen mode. If you copy the URL from the browser and share it with another user, when they access the link the panel will open directly in full-screen mode.

## Edit a report
When any team member clicks the **Edit** button to begin editing the report, a draft is automatically saved. Select **Save to report** to publish your changes.

If an edit conflict occurs, such as when two team members edit the report at once, a warning notification helps you to resolve any conflicts.

## Comment on reports
Click **Comment** to leave a comment on a report.

To comment directly on a panel, hover over the panel, then click the comment button, which looks like a speech bubble.

## Star a report
If your team has a large number of reports, click **Star** at the top of a report to add it to your favorites. When viewing your team's list of reports, click the star in a report's row to add it to your favorites. Starred reports appear at the top of the list.

From the list of reports, you can see how many members have starred each report to gauge its relative popularity.

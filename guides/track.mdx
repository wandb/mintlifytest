Track machine learning experiments with a few lines of code. You can then review the results in an [interactive dashboard](/guides/models/track/workspaces) or export your data to Python for programmatic access using our [Public API](/ref/python/public-api/index). 

Utilize W&B Integrations if you use popular frameworks such as [PyTorch](/guides/integrations/pytorch), [Keras](/guides/integrations/keras), or [Scikit](/guides/integrations/scikit). See our [Integration guides](/guides/integrations/) for a full list of integrations and information on how to add W&B to your code.

The image above shows an example dashboard where you can view and compare metrics across multiple [runs](/guides/models/track/runs/).

## How it works

Track a machine learning experiment with a few lines of code:
1. Create a [W&B Run](/guides/models/track/runs/).
2. Store a dictionary of hyperparameters, such as learning rate or model type, into your configuration ([`wandb.Run.config`](./config)).
3. Log metrics ([`wandb.Run.log()`](/guides/models/track/log/)) over time in a training loop, such as accuracy and loss.
4. Save outputs of a run, like the model weights or a table of predictions.

The following code demonstrates a common W&B experiment tracking workflow:

```python
# Start a run.
#
# When this block exits, it waits for logged data to finish uploading.
# If an exception is raised, the run is marked failed.
with wandb.init(entity="", project="my-project-name") as run:
  # Save mode inputs and hyperparameters.
  run.config.learning_rate = 0.01

  # Run your experiment code.
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Do some training...

    # Log metrics over time to visualize model performance.
    run.log({"loss": loss})

  # Upload model outputs as artifacts.
  run.log_artifact(model)
```

## Get started

Depending on your use case, explore the following resources to get started with W&B Experiments:

* Read the [W&B Quickstart](/guides/quickstart) for a step-by-step outline of the W&B Python SDK commands you could use to create, track, and use a dataset artifact.
* Explore this chapter to learn how to:
  * Create an experiment
  * Configure experiments
  * Log data from experiments
  * View results from experiments
* Explore the [W&B Python Library](/ref/python/index) within the [W&B API Reference Guide](/ref/).

This page shows how to create a Slack [automation](/guides/core/automations/). To create a webhook automation, refer to [Create a webhook automation](/guides/core/automations/create-automations/webhook) instead.

At a high level, to create a Slack automation, you take these steps:
1. [Add a Slack integration](#add-a-slack-integration), which authorizes W&B to post to the Slack instance and channel.
1. [Create the automation](#create-an-automation), which defines the [event](/guides/core/automations/automation-events) to watch for and the channel to notify.

## Add a Slack integration
A team admin can add a Slack integration to the team.

1. Log in to W&B and go to **Team Settings**.
1. In the **Slack channel integrations** section, click **Connect Slack** to add a new Slack instance. To add a channel for an existing Slack instance, click **New integration**.

1. If necessary, sign in to Slack in your browser. When prompted, grant W&B permission to post to the Slack channel you select. Read the page, then click **Search for a channel** and begin typing the channel name. Select the channel from the list, then click **Allow**.
1. In Slack, go to the channel you selected. If you see a post like `[Your Slack handle] added an integration to this channel: Weights & Biases`, the integration is configured correctly.

Now you can [create an automation](#create-an-automation) that notifies the Slack channel you configured.

## View and manage Slack integrations
A team admin can view and manage the team's Slack instances and channels.

1. Log in to W&B and go to **Team Settings**.
1. View each Slack destination in the **Slack channel integrations** section.
1. Delete a destination by clicking its trash icon.

## Create an automation
After you [add a Slack integration](#add-a-slack-integreation), select **Registry** or **Project**, then follow these steps to create an automation that notifies the Slack channel.

1. To create an automation scoped to the registry, click the **Automations** tab, then click **Create automation**. An automation that is scoped to a registry is automatically applied to all of its collections (including those created in the future).

    To create an automation scoped only to a specific collection in the registry, click the collection's action `...` menu, then click **Create automation**. Alternatively, while viewing a collection, create an automation for it using the **Create automation** button in the **Automations** section of the collection's details page.
1. Choose the [event](/guides/core/automations/automation-events) to watch for.

    Fill in any additional fields that appear, which depend upon the event. For example, if you select **An artifact alias is added**, you must specify the **Alias regex**.

    Click **Next step**.
1. Select the team that owns the [Slack integration](#add-a-slack-integration).
1. Set **Action type** to **Slack notification**. Select the Slack channel, then click **Next step**.

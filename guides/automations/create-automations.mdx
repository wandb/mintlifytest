This page gives an overview of creating and managing W&B [automations](/guides/core/automations/). For more detailed instructions, refer to [Create a Slack automation](/guides/core/automations/create-automations/slack) or [Create a webhook automation](/guides/core/automations/create-automations/webhook).

## Requirements
- A team admin can create and manage automations for the team's projects, as well as components of their automations, such as webhooks, secrets, and Slack integrations. Refer to [Team settings](/guides/models/app/settings-page/team-settings/).
- To create a registry automation, you must have access to the registry. Refer to [Configure Registry access](/guides/core/registry/configure_registry.md#registry-roles).
- To create a Slack automation, you must have permission to post to the Slack instance and channel you select.

## Create an automation
Create an automation from the project or registry's **Automations** tab. At a high level, to create an automation, follow these steps:

1. If necessary, [create a W&B secret](/guides/core/secrets) for each sensitive string required by the automation, such as an access token, password, or SSH key. Secrets are defined in your **Team Settings**. Secrets are most commonly used in webhook automations.
1. Configure the webhook or Slack integration to authorize W&B to post to Slack or run the webhook on your behalf. A single webhook or Slack integration can be used by multiple automations. These actions are defined in your **Team Settings**. 
1. In the project or registry, create the automation, which specifies the event to watch for and the action to take (such as posting to Slack or running a webhook). When you create a webhook automation, you configure the payload it sends.

Or, from a line plot in the workspace, you can quickly create a [run metric automation](/guides/core/automations/automation-events.md#run-events) for the metric it shows:

1. Hover over the panel, then click the bell icon at the top of the panel.

    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/automations/run_metric_automation_from_panel.png" alt="Automation bell icon location"  />
    </Frame>
1. Configure the automation using the basic or advanced configuration controls. For example, apply a run filter to limit the scope of the automation, or configure an absolute threshold.

- [Create a Slack automation](slack)
- [Create a webhook automation](webhook)

## View and manage automations
View and manage automations from a project or registry's **Automations** tab.

- To view an automation's details, click its name.
- To edit an automation, click its action `...` menu, then click **Edit automation**.
- To delete an automation, click its action `...` menu, then click **Delete automation**.

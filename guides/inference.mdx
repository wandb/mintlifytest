  Access open-source foundation models through W&B Weave and an OpenAI-compatible API
---

W&B Inference gives you access to leading open-source foundation models through W&B Weave and an OpenAI-compatible API. You can:

- Build AI applications and agents without signing up for a hosting provider or self-hosting a model
- Try [supported models](models) in the W&B Weave Playground

With Weave, you can trace, evaluate, monitor, and improve your W&B Inference-powered applications.

## Quickstart

Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    # The custom base URL points to W&B Inference
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',

    # Get your API key from https://wandb.ai/authorize
    api_key="<your-api-key>",

    # Optional: Team and project for usage tracking
    project="<your-team>/<your-project>",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Next steps

2. Set up your account using the [prerequisites](prerequisites)
3. Use the service through the [API](api-reference) or [UI](ui-guide)

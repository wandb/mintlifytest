{/* ## Best Practices for Fast Pages */}

Keep your pages in W&B faster and more responsive by logging within the following suggested bounds.

## Logging considerations

Use `wandb.Run.log()` to track experiment metrics.

### Distinct metric count

For faster performance, keep the total number of distinct metrics in a project under 10,000.

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init() as run:
    run.log(
        {
            "a": 1,  # "a" is a distinct metric
            "b": {
                "c": "hello",  # "b.c" is a distinct metric
                "d": [1, 2, 3],  # "b.d" is a distinct metric
            },
        }
    )
```

<Note>
W&B automatically flattens nested values. This means that if you pass a dictionary, W&B turns it into a dot-separated name. For config values, W&B supports 3 dots in the name. For summary values, W&B supports 4 dots.
</Note>

Metric names must follow certain naming constraints imposed by GraphQL. See [Metric naming constraints](/guides/models/track/log/#metric-naming-constraints) for details.

{/* ### Log media with same metric name
Log related media to the same metric name:

```python
for i, img in enumerate(images):
    # not recommended
    run.log({f"pred_img_{i}": wandb.Image(image)})

    # recommended
    run.log({"pred_imgs": [wandb.Image(image) for image in images]})
``` */}

If your workspace suddenly slows down, check whether recent runs have unintentionally logged thousands of new metrics. (This is easiest to spot by seeing sections with thousands of plots that have only one or two runs visible on them.) If they have, consider deleting those runs and recreating them with the desired metrics.

### Value width

Limit the size of a single logged value to under 1 MB and the total size of a single `run.log` call to under 25 MB. This limit does not apply to `wandb.Media` types like `wandb.Image`, `wandb.Audio`, etc.

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(project="wide-values")

# not recommended
run.log({"wide_key": range(10000000)})

# not recommended
with open("large_file.json", "r") as f:
    large_data = json.load(f)
    run.log(large_data)

run.finish()
```

Wide values can affect the plot load times for all metrics in the run, not just the metric with the wide values.

<Note>
Data is saved and tracked even if you log values wider than the recommended amount. However, your plots may load more slowly.
</Note>

### Metric frequency

Pick a logging frequency that is appropriate to the metric you are logging. As a general rule of thumb, log wider values less frequently than narrower values. W&B recommends:

- Scalars: \<100,000 logged points per metric
- Media: \<50,000 logged points per metric
- Histograms: \<10,000 logged points per metric

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(project="metric-frequency") as run:
    # Not recommended
    run.log(
        {
            "scalar": 1,  # 100,000 scalars
            "media": wandb.Image(...),  # 100,000 images
            "histogram": wandb.Histogram(...),  # 100,000 histograms
        }
    )

    # Recommended
    run.log(
        {
            "scalar": 1,  # 100,000 scalars
        },
        commit=True,
    )  # Commit batched, per-step metrics together

    run.log(
        {
            "media": wandb.Image(...),  # 50,000 images
        },
        commit=False,
    )
    
    run.log(
        {
            "histogram": wandb.Histogram(...),  # 10,000 histograms
        },
        commit=False,
    )
```

{/* Enable batching in calls to `run.log` by passing `commit=False` to minimize the total number of API calls for a given step. See [the docs](/ref/python/experiments/run/#method-runlog) for `run.log` for more details. */}

<Note>
W&B continues to accept your logged data but pages may load more slowly if you exceed guidelines.
</Note>

### Config size

Limit the total size of your run config to less than 10 MB. Logging large values could slow down your project workspaces and runs table operations.

```python
import wandb 

# Recommended
with wandb.init(
    project="config-size",
    config={
        "lr": 0.1,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "epochs": 4,
    }
) as run:
    # Your training code here
    pass

# Not recommended
with wandb.init(
    project="config-size",
    config={
        "large_list": list(range(10000000)),  # Large list
        "large_string": "a" * 10000000,  # Large string
    }
) as run:
    # Your training code here
    pass

# Not recommended
with open("large_config.json", "r") as f:
    large_config = json.load(f)
    wandb.init(config=large_config)
```

## Workspace considerations 


### Run count

To reduce loading times, keep the total number of runs in a single project under:

- 100,000 on SaaS Cloud
- 10,000 on Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed

Run counts over these thresholds can slow down operations that involve project workspaces or runs tables, especially when grouping runs or collecting a large number of distinct metrics during runs. See also the [Metric count](#metric-count) section.

If your team accesses the same set of runs frequently, such as the set of recent runs, consider [moving less frequently used runs in bulk](/guides/models/track/runs/manage-runs) to a new "archive" project, leaving a smaller set of runs in your working project.

### Workspace performance
This section gives tips for optimizing the performance of your workspace.

#### Panel count
By default, a workspace is _automatic_, and generates standard panels for each logged key. If a workspace for a large project includes panels for many logged keys, the workspace may be slow to load and use. To improve performance, you can:

1. Reset the workspace to manual mode, which includes no panels by default.
1. Use [Quick add](/guides/models/app/features/panels/#quick-add) to selectively add panels for the logged keys you need to visualize.

<Note>
Deleting unused panels one at a time has little impact on performance. Instead, reset the workspace and seletively add back only those panels you need.
</Note>

To learn more about configuring your workspace, refer to [Panels](/guides/models/app/features/panels/).

#### Section count

Having hundreds of sections in a workspace can hurt performance. Consider creating sections based on high-level groupings of metrics and avoiding an anti-pattern of one section for each metric.

If you find you have too many sections and performance is slow, consider the workspace setting to create sections by prefix rather than suffix, which can result in fewer sections and better performance.

### Metric count

When logging between 5000 and 100,000 metrics per run, W&B recommends using a [manual workspace](/guides/models/app/features/panels/#workspace-modes). In Manual mode, you can easily add and remove panels in bulk as you choose to explore different sets of metrics. With a more focused set of plots, the workspace loads faster. Metrics that are not plotted are still collected and stored as usual.

To reset a workspace to manual mode, click the workspace's action `...` menu, then click **Reset workspace**. Resetting a workspace has no impact on stored metrics for runs. See [workspace panel management](/guides/models/app/features/panels/).

### File count

Keep the total number of files uploaded for a single run under 1,000. You can use W&B Artifacts when you need to log a large number of files. Exceeding 1,000 files in a single run can slow down your run pages.

### Reports vs. Workspaces

A report is a free-form composition of arbitrary arrangements of panels, text, and media, allowing you to easily share your insights with colleagues.

By contrast, a workspace allows high-density and performant analysis of dozens to thousands of metrics across hundreds to hundreds of thousands of runs. Workspaces have optimized caching, querying, and loading capabilities, when compared to reports. Workspaces are recommended for a project that is used primarily for analysis, rather than presentation, or when you need to show 20 or more plots together.

## Python script performance

There are a few ways that the performance of your python script is reduced:

1. The size of your data is too large. Large data sizes could introduce a >1 ms overhead to the training loop.
2. The speed of your network and how the W&B backend is configured
3. If you call `wandb.Run.log()` more than a few times per second. This is due to a small latency added to the training loop every time `wandb.Run.log()` is called.

<Note>
Is frequent logging slowing your training runs down? Check out [this Colab](https://wandb.me/log-hf-colab) for methods to get better performance by changing your logging strategy.
</Note>

W&B does not assert any limits beyond rate limiting. The W&B Python SDK automatically completes an exponential "backoff" and "retry" requests that exceed limits. W&B Python SDK responds with a “Network failure” on the command line. For unpaid accounts, W&B may reach out in extreme cases where usage exceeds reasonable thresholds.

## Rate limits

W&B SaaS Cloud API implements a rate limit to maintain system integrity and ensure availability. This measure prevents any single user from monopolizing available resources in the shared infrastructure, ensuring that the service remains accessible to all users. You may encounter a lower rate limit for a variety of reasons.

<Note>
Rate limits are subject to change.
</Note>

If you encounter a rate limit, you receive a HTTP `429` `Rate limit exceeded` error and the response includes [rate limit HTTP headers](#rate-limit-http-headers).

### Rate limit HTTP headers

The preceding table describes rate limit HTTP headers:

| Header name         | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RateLimit-Limit     | The amount of quota available per time window, scaled in the range of 0 to 1000         |
| RateLimit-Remaining | The amount of quota in the current rate limit window, scaled in the range of 0 and 1000 |
| RateLimit-Reset     | The number of seconds until the current quota resets                                    |

### Rate limits on metric logging API

`wandb.Run.log()` logs your training data to W&B. This API is engaged through either online or [offline syncing](/ref/cli/wandb-sync). In either case, it imposes a rate limit quota limit in a rolling time window. This includes limits on total request size and request rate, where latter refers to the number of requests in a time duration.

W&B applies rate limits per W&B project. So if you have 3 projects in a team, each project has its own rate limit quota. Users on [Paid plans](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing) have higher rate limits than Free plans.

If you encounter a rate limit, you receive a HTTP `429` `Rate limit exceeded` error and the response includes [rate limit HTTP headers](#rate-limit-http-headers).

### Suggestions for staying under the metrics logging API rate limit

Exceeding the rate limit may delay `run.finish()` until the rate limit resets. To avoid this, consider the following strategies:

- Update your W&B Python SDK version: Ensure you are using the latest version of the W&B Python SDK. The W&B Python SDK is regularly updated and includes enhanced mechanisms for gracefully retrying requests and optimizing quota usage.
- Reduce metric logging frequency:
  Minimize the frequency of logging metrics to conserve your quota. For example, you can modify your code to log metrics every five epochs instead of every epoch:

```python
import wandb
import random

with wandb.init(project="basic-intro") as run:
    for epoch in range(10):
        # Simulate training and evaluation
        accuracy = 1 - 2 ** -epoch - random.random() / epoch
        loss = 2 ** -epoch + random.random() / epoch

        # Log metrics every 5 epochs
        if epoch % 5 == 0:
            run.log({"acc": accuracy, "loss": loss})
```

- Manual data syncing: W&B store your run data locally if you are rate limited. You can manually sync your data with the command `wandb sync <run-file-path>`. For more details, see the [`wandb sync`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync) reference.

### Rate limits on GraphQL API

The W&B Models UI and SDK’s [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api) make GraphQL requests to the server for querying and modifying data. For all GraphQL requests in SaaS Cloud, W&B applies rate limits per IP address for unauthorized requests and per user for authorized requests. The limit is based on request rate (request per second) within a fixed time window, where your pricing plan determines the default limits. For relevant SDK requests that specify a project path (for example, reports, runs, artifacts), W&B applies rate limits per project, measured by database query time.

Users on [Teams and Enterprise plans](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing) receive higher rate limits than those on the Free plan.
When you hit the rate limit while using the W&B Models SDK's public API, you see a relevant message indicating the error in the standard output.

If you encounter a rate limit, you receive a HTTP `429` `Rate limit exceeded` error and the response includes [rate limit HTTP headers](#rate-limit-http-headers).

#### Suggestions for staying under the GraphQL API rate limit

If you are fetching a large volume of data using the W&B Models SDK's [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api), consider waiting at least one second between requests. If you receive a HTTP `429` `Rate limit exceeded` error or see `RateLimit-Remaining=0` in the response headers, wait for the number of seconds specified in `RateLimit-Reset` before retrying.

## Browser considerations

The W&B app can be memory-intensive and performs best in Chrome. Depending on your computer's memory, having W&B active in 3+ tabs at once can cause performance to degrade. If you encounter unexpectedly slow performance, consider closing other tabs or applications.

## Reporting performance issues to W&B

W&B takes performance seriously and investigates every report of lag. To expedite investigation, when reporting slow loading times consider invoking W&B's built-in performance logger that captures key metrics and performance events. Append the URL parameter `&PERF_LOGGING` to a page that is loading slowly, then share the output of your console with your account team or Support.

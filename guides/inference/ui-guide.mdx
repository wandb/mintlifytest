## Try a model in the Playground

After [selecting a model](#access-the-inference-service), you can test it in the Playground. Available actions include:

- [Customize model settings and parameters](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/playground#customize-settings)
- [Add, retry, edit, and delete messages](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/playground#message-controls)
- [Save and reuse a model with custom settings](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tools/playground#saved-models)
- [Compare multiple models](#compare-multiple-models)

## Compare multiple models

You can compare Inference models side by side in the Playground. Access the Compare view from two places:

### From the Inference tab

1. Select **Inference** from the left sidebar. The available models page appears
2. Click anywhere on a model card (except the model name) to select it. The card border turns blue
3. Repeat for each model you want to compare
4. Click **Compare N models in the Playground** on any selected card. `N` shows the number of models selected
5. The comparison view opens

Now you can compare models and use all features from [Try a model in the Playground](#try-a-model-in-the-playground).

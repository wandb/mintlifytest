Learn about pricing, limits, and other important usage information before using W&B Inference.

## Pricing

For detailed model pricing information, visit [W&B Inference pricing](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing/inference).

## Purchase more credits

W&B Inference credits come with Free, Pro, and Academic plans for a limited time. Enterprise availability may vary. When credits run out:

- **Free accounts** must activate a pay-as-you-go inference (under the **Billing** tab), or upgrade to a paid plan to continue using W&B Inference. [Activate pay-as-you-go or upgrade](https://wandb.ai/subscriptions)
- **Pro plan users** are billed for overages monthly, based on [model-specific pricing](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing/inference)
- **Enterprise accounts** should contact their account executive

## Account tiers and default usage caps

Each account tier has a default spending cap to help manage costs and prevent unexpected charges. W&B requires prepayment for paid Inference access.

Some users may need to change their cap. Contact your account executive or support to adjust your limit.

| Account Tier | Default Cap | How to Change Limit |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Free | $100/month | Upgrade to Pro or Enterprise |
| Pro | $6,000/month | Contact your account executive or support for manual review |
| Enterprise | $700,000/year | Contact your account executive or support for manual review |

## Concurrency limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Concurrency limit reached for requests` response. To fix this error, reduce the number of concurrent requests. For detailed troubleshooting, see [W&B Inference support articles](/support/inference/).

W&B applies rate limits per W&B project. For example, if you have 3 projects in a team, each project has its own rate limit quota.

## Personal entities unsupported

<Note>
**Note**

Personal entities were deprecated in May 2024, so this only applies to legacy accounts.
</Note>

Personal accounts (personal entities) don't support W&B Inference. To access W&B Inference, switch to a non-personal account by creating a Team.

## Geographic restrictions

The Inference service is only available from supported geographic locations. For more information, see the [Terms of Service](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/policies/terms-of-service/terms-of-use#geographic-restrictions).

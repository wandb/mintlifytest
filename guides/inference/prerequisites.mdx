---

Complete these steps before using the W&B Inference service through the API or UI.

<Tip>
Before starting, review the [usage information and limits](usage-limits) to understand costs and restrictions.
</Tip>

## Set up your W&B account and project

You need these items to access W&B Inference:

1. **A W&B account**  
   Sign up at [W&B](https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true)

2. **A W&B API key**  
   Get your API key at [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)

3. **A W&B project**  
   Create a project in your W&B account to track usage

## Set up your environment (Python)

To use the Inference API with Python, you also need to:

1. Complete the general requirements above

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install openai weave
   ```

<Note>
**Note**

The `weave` library is optional but recommended. It lets you trace your LLM applications. Learn more in the [Weave Quickstart](../quickstart).

See [usage examples](examples) for code samples using W&B Inference with Weave.
</Note>

## Next steps

After completing the prerequisites:

- Check the [API reference](api-reference) to learn about available endpoints
- Try the [usage examples](examples) to see the service in action
- Use the [UI guide](ui-guide) to access models through the web interface

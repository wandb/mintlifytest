Use the W&B Python SDK to download a model artifact that you linked to the Model Registry. 

<Note>
You are responsible for providing additional Python functions, API calls to reconstruct, deserialize your model into a form that you can work with. 

W&B suggests that you document information on how to load models into memory with model cards. For more information, see the [Document machine learning models](./create-model-cards) page.
</Note>


Replace values within `<>` with your own:

```python
import wandb

# Initialize a run
run = wandb.init(project="<project>", entity="<entity>")

# Access and download model. Returns path to downloaded artifact
downloaded_model_path = run.use_model(name="<your-model-name>")
```

Reference a model version with one of following formats listed:

* `latest` - Use `latest` alias to specify the model version that is most recently linked.
* `v#` - Use `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, and so on to fetch a specific version in the Registered Model
* `alias` - Specify the custom alias that you and your team assigned to your model version

See [`use_model`](/ref/python/experiments/run.md#use_model) in the API Reference guide for more information on possible parameters and return type.

<summary>Example: Download and use a logged model</summary>

For example, in the proceeding code snippet a user called the `use_model` API. They specified the name of the model artifact they want to fetch and they also provided a version/alias. They then stored the path that returned from the API to the `downloaded_model_path` variable.

```python
import wandb

entity = "luka"
project = "NLP_Experiments"
alias = "latest"  # semantic nickname or identifier for the model version
model_artifact_name = "fine-tuned-model"

# Initialize a run
run = wandb.init()
# Access and download model. Returns path to downloaded artifact

downloaded_model_path = run.use_model(name=f"{entity/project/model_artifact_name}:{alias}")
```
</details>


<Note>
**Planned deprecation for W&B Model Registry in 2024**

The proceeding tabs demonstrate how to consume model artifacts using the soon to be deprecated Model Registry.

Use the W&B Registry to track, organize and consume model artifacts. For more information see the [Registry docs](/guides/registry/).

The following walkthrough shows you how to log a model to W&B. By the end of the walkthrough you will:

* Create and train a model with the MNIST dataset and the Keras framework.
* Log the model that you trained to a W&B project
* Mark the dataset used as a dependency to the model you created
* Link the model to the W&B Registry.
* Evaluate the performance of the model you link to the registry
* Mark a model version ready for production.

<Note>
* Copy the code snippets in the order presented in this guide.
* Code not unique to the Model Registry are hidden in collapsible cells.
</Note>

## Setting up

Before you get started, import the Python dependencies required for this walkthrough:

```python
import wandb
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from wandb.integration.keras import WandbMetricsLogger
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

Provide your W&B entity to the `entity` variable: 

```python
entity = "<entity>"
```


### Create a dataset artifact

First, create a dataset. The proceeding code snippet creates a function that downloads the MNIST dataset:
```python
def generate_raw_data(train_size=6000):
    eval_size = int(train_size / 6)
    (x_train, y_train), (x_eval, y_eval) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

    x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
    x_eval = x_eval.astype("float32") / 255
    x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, -1)
    x_eval = np.expand_dims(x_eval, -1)

    print("Generated {} rows of training data.".format(train_size))
    print("Generated {} rows of eval data.".format(eval_size))

    return (x_train[:train_size], y_train[:train_size]), (
        x_eval[:eval_size],
        y_eval[:eval_size],
    )

# Create dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_eval, y_eval) = generate_raw_data()
```

Next, upload the dataset to W&B. To do this, create an [artifact](/guides/artifacts/) object and add the dataset to that artifact. 

```python
project = "model-registry-dev"

model_use_case_id = "mnist"
job_type = "build_dataset"

# Initialize a W&B run
run = wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project, job_type=job_type)

# Create W&B Table for training data
train_table = wandb.Table(data=[], columns=[])
train_table.add_column("x_train", x_train)
train_table.add_column("y_train", y_train)
train_table.add_computed_columns(lambda ndx, row: {"img": wandb.Image(row["x_train"])})

# Create W&B Table for eval data
eval_table = wandb.Table(data=[], columns=[])
eval_table.add_column("x_eval", x_eval)
eval_table.add_column("y_eval", y_eval)
eval_table.add_computed_columns(lambda ndx, row: {"img": wandb.Image(row["x_eval"])})

# Create an artifact object
artifact_name = "{}_dataset".format(model_use_case_id)
artifact = wandb.Artifact(name=artifact_name, type="dataset")

# Add wandb.WBValue obj to the artifact.
artifact.add(train_table, "train_table")
artifact.add(eval_table, "eval_table")

# Persist any changes made to the artifact.
artifact.save()

# Tell W&B this run is finished.
run.finish()
```

<Note>
Storing files (such as datasets) to an artifact is useful in the context of logging models because you lets you track a model's dependencies.
</Note>


## Train a model
Train a model with the artifact dataset you created in the previous step. 

### Declare dataset artifact as an input to the run

Declare the dataset artifact you created in a previous step as the input to the W&B run. This is particularly useful in the context of logging models because declaring an artifact as an input to a run lets you track the dataset (and the version of the dataset) used to train a specific model. W&B uses the information collected to create a [lineage map](./model-lineage). 

Use the `use_artifact` API to both declare the dataset artifact as the input of the run and to retrieve the artifact itself. 

```python
job_type = "train_model"
config = {
    "optimizer": "adam",
    "batch_size": 128,
    "epochs": 5,
    "validation_split": 0.1,
}

# Initialize a W&B run
run = wandb.init(project=project, job_type=job_type, config=config)

# Retrieve the dataset artifact
version = "latest"
name = "{}:{}".format("{}_dataset".format(model_use_case_id), version)
artifact = run.use_artifact(artifact_or_name=name)

# Get specific content from the dataframe
train_table = artifact.get("train_table")
x_train = train_table.get_column("x_train", convert_to="numpy")
y_train = train_table.get_column("y_train", convert_to="numpy")
```

For more information about tracking the inputs and output of a model, see [Create model lineage](./model-lineage) map. 

### Define and train model

For this walkthrough, define a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras to classify images from the MNIST dataset. 

<details>
<summary>Train CNN on MNIST data</summary>

```python
# Store values from our config dictionary into variables for easy accessing
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
loss = "categorical_crossentropy"
optimizer = run.config["optimizer"]
metrics = ["accuracy"]
batch_size = run.config["batch_size"]
epochs = run.config["epochs"]
validation_split = run.config["validation_split"]

# Create model architecture
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
        layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(loss=loss, optimizer=optimizer, metrics=metrics)

# Generate labels for training data
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)

# Create training and test set
x_t, x_v, y_t, y_v = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.33)
```
Next, train the model:

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(
    x=x_t,
    y=y_t,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    epochs=epochs,
    validation_data=(x_v, y_v),
    callbacks=[WandbCallback(log_weights=True, log_evaluation=True)],
)
```

Finally, save the model locally on your machine: 

```python
# Save model locally
path = "model.h5"
model.save(path)
```
</details>



## Log and link a model to the Model Registry
Use the [`link_model`](/ref/python/experiments/run.md#link_model) API to log model one ore more files to a W&B run and link it to the [W&B Model Registry](./).

```python
path = "./model.h5"
registered_model_name = "MNIST-dev"

run.link_model(path=path, registered_model_name=registered_model_name)
run.finish()
```

W&B creates a registered model for you if the name you specify for `registered-model-name` does not already exist. 

See [`link_model`](/ref/python/experiments/run.md#link_model) in the API Reference guide for optional parameters.

## Evaluate the performance of a model
It is common practice to evaluate the performance of a one or more models. 

First, get the evaluation dataset artifact stored in W&B in a previous step.

```python
job_type = "evaluate_model"

# Initialize a run
run = wandb.init(project=project, entity=entity, job_type=job_type)

model_use_case_id = "mnist"
version = "latest"

# Get dataset artifact, mark it as a dependency
artifact = run.use_artifact(
    "{}:{}".format("{}_dataset".format(model_use_case_id), version)
)

# Get desired dataframe
eval_table = artifact.get("eval_table")
x_eval = eval_table.get_column("x_eval", convert_to="numpy")
y_eval = eval_table.get_column("y_eval", convert_to="numpy")
```

Download the [model version](./model-management-concepts.md#model-version) from W&B that you want to evaluate. Use the `use_model` API to access and download your model.

```python
alias = "latest"  # alias
name = "mnist_model"  # name of the model artifact

# Access and download model. Returns path to downloaded artifact
downloaded_model_path = run.use_model(name=f"{name}:{alias}")
```

Load the Keras model and compute the loss:

```python
model = keras.models.load_model(downloaded_model_path)

y_eval = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_eval, 10)
(loss, _) = model.evaluate(x_eval, y_eval)
score = (loss, _)
```

Finally, log the loss metric to the W&B run:

```python
# # Log metrics, images, tables, or any data useful for evaluation.
run.log(data={"loss": (loss, _)})
```


## Promote a model version 
Mark a model version ready for the next stage of your machine learning workflow with a [*model alias*](./model-management-concepts.md#model-alias). Each registered model can have one or more model aliases. A model alias can only belong to a single model version at a time.

For example, suppose that after evaluating a model's performance, you are confident that the model is ready for production. To promote that model version, add the `production` alias to that specific model version. 

<Note>
The `production` alias is one of the most common aliases used to mark a model as production-ready.
</Note>

You can add an alias to a model version interactively with the W&B App UI or programmatically with the Python SDK. The following steps show how to add an alias with the W&B Model Registry App:


1. Navigate to the [Model Registry App](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Click **View details** next to the name of your registered model.
3. Within the **Versions** section, click the **View** button next to the name of the model version you want to promote. 
4. Next to the **Aliases** field, click the plus icon (**+**). 
5. Type in `production` into the field that appears.
6. Press Enter on your keyboard.

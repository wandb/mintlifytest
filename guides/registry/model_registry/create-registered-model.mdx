Create a [registered model](./model-management-concepts.md#registered-model) to hold all the candidate models for your modeling tasks. You can create a registered model interactively within the Model Registry or programmatically with the Python SDK.

## Programmatically create registered a model
Programmatically register a model with the W&B Python SDK. W&B automatically creates a registered model for you if the registered model doesn't exist.

Ensure to replace other the values enclosed in `<>` with your own:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(entity="<entity>", project="<project>")
run.link_model(path="<path-to-model>", registered_model_name="<registered-model-name>")
run.finish()
```

The name you provide for `registered_model_name` is the name that appears in the [Model Registry App](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).

## Interactively create a registered model
Interactively create a registered model within the [Model Registry App](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).

1. Navigate to the [Model Registry App](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).

2. Click the **New registered model** button located in the top right of the Model Registry page.

3. From the panel that appears, select the entity you want the registered model to belong to from the **Owning Entity** dropdown.

</Frame>
4. Provide a name for your model in the **Name** field. 
5. From the **Type** dropdown, select the type of artifacts to link to the registered model.
6. (Optional) Add a description about your model in the **Description** field. 
7. (Optional) Within the **Tags** field, add one or more tags. 
8. Click **Register model**.


<Note>
Manual linking a model to the model registry is useful for one-off models. However, it is often useful to [programmatically link model versions to the model registry](link-model-version#programmatically-link-a-model).

For example, suppose you have a nightly job. It is tedious to manually link a model created each night. Instead, you could create a script that evaluates the model, and if the model improves in performance, link that model to the model registry with the W&B Python SDK.

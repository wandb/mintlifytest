The state (**State**), creation time (**Created**), the entity that started the sweep (**Creator**), the number of runs completed (**Run count**), and the time it took to compute the sweep (**Compute time**) are displayed in the Sweeps UI. The expected number of runs a sweep will create (**Est. Runs**) is provided when you do a grid search over a discrete search space. You can also click on a sweep to pause, resume, stop, or kill the sweep from the interface.

Use the [W&B CLI](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) to pause, resume, and cancel a sweep. The CLI's `sweep` command uses flags such as `--pause` and `--resume` to control the sweep's ability to create new W&B runs, with different effects on existing runs:

- `--pause`: When you pause a sweep, the agent creates no new runs until you resume the sweep. Existing runs continue to execute normally.
- `--resume`: When you resume a sweep, the agent continues creating new runs according to the search strategy.
- `--stop`: When you stop a sweep, the agent stops creating new runs. Existing runs continue to completion.
- `--cancel`: When you cancel a sweep, the agent immediately kills all currently executing runs and stops creating new runs.


Use the following guidance to pause, resume, and cancel a sweep. In each case, provide the sweep ID that was generated when you initialized a sweep.

### Pause a sweep

Pause a sweep so it temporarily stops creating new runs. Runs that are already executing will continue to run until completion. Use the [`wandb sweep --pause`](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) command to pause a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that you want to pause.

```bash
wandb sweep --pause entity/project/sweep_ID
```

### Resume a sweep

Resume a paused sweep with the [`wandb sweep --resume`](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) command. The sweep will start creating new runs again according to its search strategy. Provide the sweep ID that you want to resume:

```bash
wandb sweep --resume entity/project/sweep_ID
```

### Stop a sweep

Finish a sweep to stop creating new runs while letting currently executing runs finish gracefully. Use the [`wandb sweep --stop`](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) command:

```bash
wandb sweep --stop entity/project/sweep_ID
```

### Cancel a sweep

Cancel a sweep to immediately kill all running runs and stop creating new runs. This is the only sweep command that forcibly terminates existing runs. Use the [`wandb sweep --cancel`](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) command to cancel a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that you want to cancel.

```bash
wandb sweep --cancel entity/project/sweep_ID
```

For a full list of CLI command options, see the [wandb sweep](/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) CLI Reference Guide.

## Understanding sweep and run statuses

A sweep orchestrates multiple runs to explore hyperparameter combinations. Understanding how sweep status and run status interact is crucial for effectively managing your hyperparameter optimization.

### Key differences

- **Sweep status** controls whether new runs are created (Running, Paused, Stopped, Cancelled, Finished, Failed, Crashed)
- **Run status** reflects the execution state of individual runs (Pending, Running, Finished, Failed, Crashed, Killed)

### Best practices

- Use `--pause` instead of cancel when you want to temporarily halt exploration without losing running experiments
- Monitor individual run statuses to identify systematic failures
- Use `--stop` for graceful termination when you've found satisfactory hyperparameters
- Reserve `--cancel` for emergencies when runs are consuming excessive resources or producing errors

<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.
</Note>


If you've determined to self-managed W&B Server, W&B recommends using the [W&B Server GCP Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/wandb/wandb/google/latest) to deploy the platform on GCP.

The module documentation is extensive and contains all available options that can be used.

Before you start, W&B recommends that you choose one of the [remote backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/remote) available for Terraform to store the [State File](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state).

The State File is the necessary resource to roll out upgrades or make changes in your deployment without recreating all components.

The Terraform Module will deploy the following `mandatory` components:

- VPC
- Cloud SQL for MySQL
- Cloud Storage Bucket
- Google Kubernetes Engine
- KMS Crypto Key
- Load Balancer

Other deployment options can also include the following optional components:

- Memory store for Redis
- Pub/Sub messages system

## Pre-requisite permissions

The account that will run the terraform need to have the role `roles/owner` in the GCP project used.

## General steps

The steps on this topic are common for any deployment option covered by this documentation.

1. Prepare the development environment.
   - Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
   - We recommend creating a Git repository with the code that will be used, but you can keep your files locally.
   - Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Authenticate with GCP (make sure to [install gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) before)
     `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. Create the `terraform.tfvars` file.

   The `tvfars` file content can be customized according to the installation type, but the minimum recommended will look like the example below.

   ```bash
   project_id  = "wandb-project"
   region      = "europe-west2"
   zone        = "europe-west2-a"
   namespace   = "wandb"
   license     = "xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzz"
   subdomain   = "wandb-gcp"
   domain_name = "wandb.ml"
   ```

   The variables defined here need to be decided before the deployment because. The `namespace` variable will be a string that will prefix all resources created by Terraform.

   The combination of `subdomain` and `domain` will form the FQDN that W&B will be configured. In the example above, the W&B FQDN will be `wandb-gcp.wandb.ml`


3. Create the file `variables.tf`

   For every option configured in the `terraform.tfvars` Terraform requires a correspondent variable declaration.

   ```
   variable "project_id" {
     type        = string
     description = "Project ID"
   }

   variable "region" {
     type        = string
     description = "Google region"
   }

   variable "zone" {
     type        = string
     description = "Google zone"
   }

   variable "namespace" {
     type        = string
     description = "Namespace prefix used for resources"
   }

   variable "domain_name" {
     type        = string
     description = "Domain name for accessing the Weights & Biases UI."
   }

   variable "subdomain" {
     type        = string
     description = "Subdomain for access the Weights & Biases UI."
   }

   variable "license" {
     type        = string
     description = "W&B License"
   }
   ```

## Deployment - Recommended (~20 mins)

This is the most straightforward deployment option configuration that will create all `Mandatory` components and install in the `Kubernetes Cluster` the latest version of `W&B`.

1. Create the `main.tf`

   In the same directory where you created the files in the [General Steps](#general-steps), create a file `main.tf` with the following content:

   ```
   provider "google" {
    project = var.project_id
    region  = var.region
    zone    = var.zone
   }

   provider "google-beta" {
    project = var.project_id
    region  = var.region
    zone    = var.zone
   }

   data "google_client_config" "current" {}

   provider "kubernetes" {
     host                   = "https://${module.wandb.cluster_endpoint}"
     cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.wandb.cluster_ca_certificate)
     token                  = data.google_client_config.current.access_token
   }

   # Spin up all required services
   module "wandb" {
     source  = "wandb/wandb/google"
     version = "~> 5.0"

     namespace   = var.namespace
     license     = var.license
     domain_name = var.domain_name
     subdomain   = var.subdomain
   }

   # You'll want to update your DNS with the provisioned IP address
   output "url" {
     value = module.wandb.url
   }

   output "address" {
     value = module.wandb.address
   }

   output "bucket_name" {
     value = module.wandb.bucket_name
   }
   ```

2. Deploy W&B

   To deploy W&B, execute the following commands:

   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
   ```

## Deployment with REDIS Cache

Another deployment option uses `Redis` to cache the SQL queries and speedup the application response when loading the metrics for the experiments.

You need to add the option `create_redis = true` to the same `main.tf` file specified in the recommended [Deployment option section](#deployment---recommended-20-mins) to enable the cache.

```
[...]

module "wandb" {
  source  = "wandb/wandb/google"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  namespace    = var.namespace
  license      = var.license
  domain_name  = var.domain_name
  subdomain    = var.subdomain
  allowed_inbound_cidrs = ["*"]
  #Enable Redis
  create_redis = true

}
[...]
```

## Deployment with External Queue

Deployment option 3 consists of enabling the external `message broker`. This is optional because the W&B brings embedded a broker. This option doesn't bring a performance improvement.

The GCP resource that provides the message broker is the `Pub/Sub`, and to enable it, you will need to add the option `use_internal_queue = false` to the same `main.tf` specified in the recommended [Deployment option section](#deployment---recommended-20-mins)

```
[...]

module "wandb" {
  source  = "wandb/wandb/google"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  namespace          = var.namespace
  license            = var.license
  domain_name        = var.domain_name
  subdomain          = var.subdomain
  allowed_inbound_cidrs = ["*"]
  #Create and use Pub/Sub
  use_internal_queue = false

}

[...]

```

## Other deployment options

You can combine all three deployment options adding all configurations to the same file.
The [Terraform Module](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-google-wandb) provides several options that can be combined along with the standard options and the minimal configuration found in `Deployment - Recommended`

{/* ## Upgrades (coming soon) */}

## Manual configuration

To use a GCP Storage bucket as a file storage backend for W&B, you will need to create a:

* [PubSub Topic and Subscription](#create-pubsub-topic-and-subscription)
* [Storage Bucket](#create-storage-bucket)
* [PubSub Notification](#create-pubsub-notification)


### Create PubSub Topic and Subscription

Follow the procedure below to create a PubSub topic and subscription:

1. Navigate to the Pub/Sub service within the GCP Console 
2. Select **Create Topic** and provide a name for your topic. 
3. At the bottom of the page, select **Create subscription**. Ensure **Delivery Type** is set to **Pull**.
4. Click **Create**.

Make sure the service account or account that your instance is running has the `pubsub.admin` role on this subscription. For details, see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#console.

### Create Storage Bucket

1. Navigate to the **Cloud Storage Buckets** page.
2. Select **Create bucket** and provide a name for your bucket. Ensure you choose a **Standard** [storage class](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes). 

Ensure that the service account or account that your instance is running has both:
* access to the bucket you created in the previous step
* `storage.objectAdmin` role on this bucket. For details, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add

<Note>
Your instance also needs the `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission in GCP to create signed file URLs. Add `Service Account Token Creator` role to the service account or IAM member that your instance is running as to enable permission.
</Note>

3. Enable CORS access. This can only be done using the command line. First, create a JSON file with the following CORS configuration.

```
cors:
- maxAgeSeconds: 3600
  method:
   - GET
   - PUT
     origin:
   - '<YOUR_W&B_SERVER_HOST>'
     responseHeader:
   - Content-Type
```

Note that the scheme, host, and port of the values for the origin must match exactly. 

4. Make sure you have `gcloud` installed, and logged into the correct GCP Project. 
5. Next, run the following:

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://<BUCKET_NAME> --cors-file=<CORS_CONFIG_FILE>
```

### Create PubSub Notification
Follow the procedure below in your command line to create a notification stream from the Storage Bucket to the Pub/Sub topic. 

<Note>
You must use the CLI to create a notification stream. Ensure you have `gcloud` installed.
</Note>

1. Log into your GCP Project.
2. Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics list  # list names of topics for reference
gcloud storage ls          # list names of buckets for reference

# create bucket notification
gcloud storage buckets notifications create gs://<BUCKET_NAME> --topic=<TOPIC_NAME>
```

[Further reference is available on the Cloud Storage website.](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reporting-changes)

### Configure W&B server

1. Finally, navigate to the W&B `System Connections` page at `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/console/settings/system`. 
2. Select the provider `Google Cloud Storage (gcs)`, 
3. Provide the name of the GCS bucket

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/hosting/configure_file_store_gcp.png" alt="GCP file storage configuration"  />
</Frame>

4. Press **Update settings** to apply the new settings.

## Upgrade W&B Server

Follow the steps outlined here to update W&B:

1. Add `wandb_version` to your configuration in your `wandb_app` module. Provide the version of W&B you want to upgrade to. For example, the following line specifies W&B version `0.48.1`:

  ```
  module "wandb_app" {
      source  = "wandb/wandb/kubernetes"
      version = "~>5.0"

      license       = var.license
      wandb_version = "0.58.1"
  ```

  <Note>
Alternatively, you can add the `wandb_version` to the `terraform.tfvars` and create a variable with the same name and instead of using the literal value, use the `var.wandb_version`
</Note>

2. After you update your configuration, complete the steps described in the [Deployment option section](#deployment---recommended-20-mins).

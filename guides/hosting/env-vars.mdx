In addition to configuring instance level settings via the System Settings admin UI, W&B also provides a way to configure these values via code using Environment Variables. Also, refer to [advanced configuration for IAM](./iam/advanced_env_vars).

| `LOGGING_ENABLED`                  | When set to true, access logs are streamed to stdout. You can also mount a sidecar container and tail `/var/log/gorilla.log` without setting this variable.                              |
| `GORILLA_ALLOW_USER_TEAM_CREATION` | When set to true, allows non-admin users to create a new team. False by default.                                                                                                         |
| `GORILLA_CUSTOMER_SECRET_STORE_SOURCE` | Sets the secret manager for storing team secrets used by W&B Weave.

| `GORILLA_DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD`    | How long to retain deleted data from runs in hours. Deleted run data is unrecoverable. Append an `h` to the input value. For example, `"24h"`. |
| `GORILLA_DISABLE_PERSONAL_ENTITY`  | When set to true, turns off [personal entities](/support/kb-articles/difference_team_entity_user_entity_mean_me). Prevents creation of new personal projects in their personal entities and prevents writing to existing personal projects. |

| `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR`               | Where to store all downloaded artifacts. If unset, defaults to the `artifacts` directory relative to your training script. Make sure this directory exists and the running user has permission to write to it. This does not control the location of generated metadata files, which you can set using the `WANDB_DIR` environment variable. |
| `WANDB_DATA_DIR`                   | Where to upload staging artifacts. The default location depends on your platform, because it uses the value of `user_data_dir` from the `platformdirs` Python package. Make sure this directory exists and the running user has permission to write to it. |
| `WANDB_DIR`                        | Where to store all generated files. If unset, defaults to the `wandb` directory relative to your training script. Make sure this directory exists and the running user has permission to write to it. This does not control the location of downloaded artifacts, which you can set using the `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR` environment variable. |
| `WANDB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`        | For [identity federation](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/identity_federation), the absolute path to the local directory where Java Web Tokens (JWTs) are stored. |
<Note>
Use the GORILLA_DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD environment variable cautiously. Data is removed immediately once the environment variable is set. We also recommend that you backup both the database and the storage bucket before you enable this flag.

## Advanced Reliability Settings

### Redis

Configuring an external Redis server is optional but recommended for production systems. Redis helps improve the reliability of the service and enable caching to decrease load times, especially in large projects. Use a managed Redis service such ElastiCache with high availability (HA) and the following specifications:

- Minimum 4GB of memory, suggested 8GB
- Redis version 6.x
- In transit encryption
- Authentication enabled

To configure the Redis instance with W&B, you can navigate to the W&B settings page at `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/system-admin`. Enable the "Use an external Redis instance" option, and fill in the Redis connection string in the following format:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/hosting/configure_redis.png" alt="Configuring REDIS in W&B"  />
</Frame>

You can also configure Redis using the environment variable `REDIS` on the container or in your Kubernetes deployment. Alternatively, you could also setup `REDIS` as a Kubernetes secret.

This page assumes the Redis instance is running at the default port of `6379`. If you configure a different port, setup authentication and also want to have TLS enabled on the `redis` instance the connection string format would look something like: `redis://$USER:$PASSWORD@$HOST:$PORT?tls=true`

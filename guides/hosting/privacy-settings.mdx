Organization and Team admins can configure a set of privacy settings at the organization and team scopes respectively. When configured at the organization scope, organization admins enforce those settings for all teams in that organization.

<Note>
W&B recommends organization admins to enforce a privacy setting only after communicating that in advance to all team admins and users in their organization. This is to avoid unexpected changes in their workflows.

## Configure privacy settings for a team

Team admins can configure privacy settings for their respective teams from within the `Privacy` section of the team **Settings** tab. Each setting is configurable as long as it's not enforced at the organization scope:

* Hide this team from all non-members
* Make all future team projects private (public sharing not allowed)
* Allow any team member to invite other members (not just admins)
* Turn off public sharing to outside of team for reports in private projects. This turns off existing magic links.
* Allow users with matching organization email domain to join this team.
    * This setting is applicable only to [SaaS Cloud](./hosting-options/saas_cloud). It's not available in [Dedicated Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) or [Self-managed](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/) instances.
* Enable code saving by default.

## Enforce privacy settings for all teams

Organization admins can enforce privacy settings for all teams in their organization from within the `Privacy` section of the **Settings** tab in the account or organization dashboard. If organization admins enforce a setting, team admins are not allowed to configure that within their respective teams.

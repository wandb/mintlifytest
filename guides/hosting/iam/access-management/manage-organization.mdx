### Invite a user

admins can invite users to their organization, as well as specific teams within the organization.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Multi-tenant SaaS Cloud">
1. Navigate to https://wandb.ai/home.
1. In the upper right corner of the page, select the **User menu** dropdown. Within the **Account** section of the dropdown, select **Users**.

6. Select the **Add new user** button.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Auto provision users

A W&B user with matching email domain can sign in to your W&B Organization with Single Sign-On (SSO) if you configure SSO and your SSO provider permits it. SSO is available for all Enterprise licenses.

<Note>
**Enable SSO for authentication**

W&B strongly recommends and encourages that users authenticate using Single Sign-On (SSO). Reach out to your W&B team to enable SSO for your organization. 

To learn more about how to setup SSO with Dedicated cloud or Self-managed instances, refer to [SSO with OIDC](../authentication/sso) or [SSO with LDAP](../authentication/ldap).
</Note>


W&B assigned auto-provisioning users "Member" roles by default. You can change the role of auto-provisioned users at any time.

Auto-provisioning users with SSO is on by default for Dedicated cloud instances and Self-managed deployments. You can turn off auto provisioning. Turning auto provisioning off enables you to selectively add specific users to your W&B organization.

The proceeding tabs describe how to turn off SSO based on deployment type:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dedicated cloud">
Reach out to your W&B team if you are on Dedicated cloud instance and you want to turn off auto provisioning with SSO.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-managed">
Use the W&B Console to turn off auto provisioning with SSO:

1. Navigate to `https://<org-name>.io/console/settings/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name.
2. Choose **Security** 
3. Select the **Disable SSO Provisioning** to turn off auto provisioning with SSO.

{/* For Self-managed deployments, you can configure the setting `DISABLE_SSO_PROVISIONING=true` to turn off auto provisioning with SSO. */}
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Auto provisioning with SSO is useful for adding users to an organization at scale because organization admins do not need to generate individual user invitations.
</Note>

### Create custom roles
<Note>
An Enterprise license is required to create or assign custom roles on Dedicated cloud or Self-managed deployments.
</Note>

Organization admins can compose a new role based on either the View-Only or Member role and add additional permissions to achieve fine-grained access control. Team admins can assign a custom role to a team member. Custom roles are created at the organization level but are assigned at the team level.

To create a custom role:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Multi-tenant SaaS Cloud">
1. Navigate to https://wandb.ai/home.
1. In the upper right corner of the page, select the **User menu** dropdown. Within the **Account** section of the dropdown, select **Settings**.
1. Click **Roles**.
1. In the **Custom roles** section, click **Create a role**.
1. Provide a name for the role. Optionally provide a description.
1. Choose the role to base the custom role on, either **Viewer** or **Member**.
1. To add permissions, click the **Search permissions** field, then select one or more permissions to add.
1. Review the **Custom role permissions** section, which summarizes the permissions the role has.
1. Click **Create Role**.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Dedicated or Self-managed">
Use the W&B Console to turn off auto provisioning with SSO:

1. Navigate to `https://<org-name>.io/console/settings/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name.
1. In the **Custom roles** section, click **Create a role**.
1. Provide a name for the role. Optionally provide a description.
1. Choose the role to base the custom role on, either **Viewer** or **Member**.
1. To add permissions, click the **Search permissions** field, then select one or more permissions to add.
1. Review the **Custom role permissions** section, which summarizes the permissions the role has.
1. Click **Create Role**.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

A team admin can now assign the custom role to members of a team from the [Team settings](#invite-users-to-a-team).

### Domain capture
Domain capture helps your employees join the your companies organization to ensure new users do not create assets outside of your company jurisdiction. 

<Note>
**Domains must be unique**

Domains are unique identifiers. This means that you can not use a domain that is already in use by another organization.
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Multi-tenant SaaS Cloud">
Domain capture lets you automatically add people with a company email address, such as  `@example.com`, to your W&B SaaS cloud organization. This helps all your employees join the right organization and ensures that new users do not create assets outside of your company jurisdiction. 

This table summarizes the behavior of new and existing users with and without domain capture enabled:

| | With domain capture | Without domain capture |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| New users | Users who sign up for W&B from verified domains are automatically added as members to your organization’s default team. They can choose additional teams to join at sign up, if you enable team joining. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation. | Users can create W&B accounts without knowing there is a centralized organization available. | 
| Invited users | Invited users automatically join your organization when accepting your invite. Invited users are not automatically added as members to your organization’s default team. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation. | Invited users automatically join your organization when accepting your invite. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation.| 
| Existing users | Existing users with verified email addresses from your domains can join your organization’s teams within the W&B App. All data that existing users create before joining your organization remains. W&B does not migrate the existing user's data. | Existing W&B users may be spread across multiple organizations and teams.|

To automatically assign non-invited new users to a default team when they join your organization:

1. Navigate to https://wandb.ai/home.
2. In the upper right corner of the page, select the **User menu** dropdown. From the dropdown, choose **Settings**.
3. Within the **Settings** tab, select **General**.
4. Choose the **Claim domain** button within **Domain capture**.
5. Select the team that you want new users to automatically join from the **Default team** dropdown. If no teams are available, you'll need to update team settings. See the instructions in [Add and manage teams](#add-and-manage-teams).
6. Click the **Claim email domain** button.

You must enable domain matching within a team's settings before you can automatically assign non-invited new users to that team.

1. Navigate to the team's dashboard at `https://wandb.ai/<team-name>`. Where `<team-name>` is the name of the team you want to enable domain matching.
2. Select **Team settings** in the global navigation on the left side of the team's dashboard.
3. Within the **Privacy** section, toggle the "Recommend new users with matching email domains join this team upon signing up" option.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Dedicated or Self-managed">
Reach out to your W&B Account Team if you use Dedicated or Self-managed deployment type to configure domain capture. Once configured, your W&B SaaS instance automatically prompts users who create a W&B account with your company email address to contact your admin to request access to your Dedicated or Self-managed instance.

| | With domain capture | Without domain capture |
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| New users | Users who sign up for W&B on SaaS cloud from verified domains are automatically prompted to contact an admin with an email address you customize. They can still create an organizations on SaaS cloud to trial the product. | Users can create W&B SaaS cloud accounts without learning their company has a centralized dedicated instance. | 
| Existing users | Existing W&B users may be spread across multiple organizations and teams.| Existing W&B users may be spread across multiple organizations and teams.|
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Assign or update a user's role

Every member in an Organization has an organization role and seat for both W&B Models and Weave. The type of seat they have determines both their billing status and the actions they can take in each product line.

You initially assign an organization role to a user when you invite them to your organization. You can change any user's role at a later time.

A user within an organization can have one of the proceeding roles:

| Role | Descriptions |
| ----- | ----- |
| admin| A instance admin who can add or remove other users to the organization, change user roles, manage custom roles, add teams and more. W&B recommends ensuring there is more than one admin in the event that your admin is unavailable. |
| Member | A regular user of the organization, invited by an instance admin. A organization member cannot invite other users or manage existing users in the organization. |
| Viewer (Enterprise-only feature) | A view-only user of your organization, invited by an instance admin. A viewer only has read access to the organization and the underlying teams that they are a member of. |
|Custom Roles (Enterprise-only feature) | Custom roles allow organization admins to compose new roles by inheriting from the preceding View-Only or Member roles, and adding additional permissions to achieve fine-grained access control. Team admins can then assign any of those custom roles to users in their respective teams.|

To change a user's role:

1. Navigate to https://wandb.ai/home.
2. In the upper right corner of the page, select the **User menu** dropdown. From the dropdown, choose **Users**.
4. Provide the name or email of the user in the search bar.
4. Select a role from the **TEAM ROLE** dropdown next to the name of the user.

### Assign or update a user's access

A user within an organization has one of the proceeding model seat or weave access types: full, viewer, or no access.  

| Seat type | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Full | Users with this role type have full permissions to write, read, and export data for Models or Weave. |
| Viewer | A view-only user of your organization. A viewer only has read access to the organization and the underlying teams that they are a part of, and view only access to Models or Weave. |
| No access | Users with this role have no access to the Models or Weave products. |

Model seat type and weave access type are defined at the organization level, and inherited by the team. If you want to change a user's seat type, navigate to the organization settings and follow the proceeding steps:

1. For SaaS users, navigate to your organization's settings at `https://wandb.ai/account-settings/<organization>/settings`. Ensure to replace the values enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) with your organization name. For other Dedicated and Self-managed deployments, navigate to `https://<your-instance>.wandb.io/org/dashboard`.
2. Select the **Users** tab.

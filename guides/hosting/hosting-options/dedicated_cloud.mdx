## Use W&B Dedicated Cloud for single-tenant SaaS

W&B Dedicated Cloud is a single-tenant, fully managed platform deployed in W&B's AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud accounts. Each Dedicated Cloud instance has its own isolated network, compute and storage from other W&B Dedicated Cloud instances. Your W&B specific metadata and data is stored in an isolated cloud storage and is processed using isolated cloud compute services. 

W&B Dedicated Cloud is available in [multiple global regions for each cloud provider](./dedicated_regions)

## Data security 

You can bring your own bucket (BYOB) using the [secure storage connector](/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector) at the [instance and team levels](/guides/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector.md#configuration-options) to store your files such as models, datasets, and more.

Similar to W&B Multi-tenant Cloud, you can configure a single bucket for multiple teams or you can use separate buckets for different teams. If you do not configure secure storage connector for a team, that data is stored in the instance level bucket.

In addition to BYOB with secure storage connector, you can use [IP allowlisting](/guides/hosting/data-security/ip-allowlisting) to restrict access to your Dedicated Cloud instance from only trusted network locations. 

You can connect privately to your Dedicated Cloud instance using [cloud provider's secure connectivity solution](/guides/hosting/data-security/private-connectivity).

You are responsible for ensuring that your deployment complies with your organization's policies and [Security Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide), if applicable.

## Identity and access management (IAM)

Use the identity and access management capabilities for secure authentication and effective authorization in your W&B Organization. The following features are available for IAM in Dedicated Cloud instances:

* Authenticate with [SSO using OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/sso) or with [LDAP](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/ldap).
* [Configure appropriate user roles](/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/manage-organization.md#assign-or-update-a-users-role) at the scope of the organization and within a team.
* Define the scope of a W&B project to limit who can view, edit, and submit W&B runs to it with [restricted projects](/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/restricted-projects).
* Leverage JSON Web Tokens with [identity federation](/guides/hosting/iam/authentication/identity_federation) to access W&B APIs.

## Monitor

Use [Audit logs](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/audit-logging) to track user activity within your teams and to conform to your enterprise governance requirements. Also, you can view organization usage in our Dedicated Cloud instance with [W&B Organization Dashboard](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/org_dashboard).

## Maintenance

Similar to W&B Multi-tenant Cloud, you do not incur the overhead and costs of provisioning and maintaining the W&B platform with Dedicated Cloud.

To understand how W&B manages updates on Dedicated Cloud, refer to the [server release process](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/server-upgrade-process).

## Compliance

Security controls for W&B Dedicated Cloud are periodically audited internally and externally. Refer to the [W&B Security Portal](https://security.wandb.ai/) to request the security and compliance documents for your product assessment exercise.

## Migration options

Migration to Dedicated Cloud from a [Self-Managed instance](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/) or [Multi-tenant Cloud](../saas_cloud) is supported, subject to specific limits and migration-related constraints

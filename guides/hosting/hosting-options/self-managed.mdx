## Use W&B Self-Managed on cloud or on-prem infrastructure

<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](../saas_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.
</Note>

Deploy W&B Server on your [AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud account](#deploy-wb-server-within-self-managed-cloud-accounts) or within your [on-premises infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure). 

Your IT/DevOps/MLOps team is responsible for:
- Provisioning your deployment.
- Securing your infrastructure in accordance with your organization's policies and [Security Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide), if applicable.
- Managing upgrades and applying patches.
- Continuously maintaining your Self-Managed W&B Server instance.


{/* Check [Obtain your W&B Server license](#obtain-your-wb-server-license) to complete the setup. */}

## Deploy W&B Server within self-managed cloud accounts

W&B recommends that you use official W&B Terraform scripts to deploy W&B Server into your AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud account.

See specific cloud provider documentation for more information on how to set up W&B Server in [AWS](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/install-on-public-cloud/aws-tf), [GCP](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/install-on-public-cloud/gcp-tf), or [Azure](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/install-on-public-cloud/azure-tf).

## Deploy W&B Server in on-prem infrastructure

To set up W&B Server in your on-premises infrastructure, you need to configure several infrastructure components. Some of those components include, but are not limited to: 

- (Strongly recommended) Kubernetes cluster
- MySQL 8 database cluster
- Amazon S3-compatible object storage
- Redis cache cluster

See [Install on on-prem infrastructure](/guides/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/bare-metal) for detailed instructions to install W&B Server on your on-prem infrastructure. W&B can provide recommendations for the different components and provide guidance through the installation process.

## Deploy W&B Server on a custom cloud platform

You can deploy W&B Server to a cloud platform that is not AWS, GCP, or Azure. Requirements for that are similar to that for deploying in [on-prem infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure).

## Obtain your W&B Server license

You need a W&B trial license to complete your configuration of the W&B server. Open the [Deploy Manager](https://deploy.wandb.ai/deploy) to generate a free trial license. 

<Note>
If you do not already have a W&B account, create one to generate your free license.

If you need an enterprise license for W&B Server which includes support for important security & other enterprise-friendly capabilities, [submit this form](https://wandb.ai/site/for-enterprise/self-hosted-trial) or reach out to your W&B team.
</Note>

This page shows various ways to view activity within your W&B organization.

## View user status and activity

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dedicated / Self-managed">
1. To access the **Organization Dashboard**, navigate to `https://<org-name>.io/org/dashboard/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name. The **Users** tab opens by default. It lists all users, along with data about each user.
1. To sort the list by user status, click the **Last Active** column label. Each user's status is one of the following:

    * **Invite pending**: Admin has sent invite but user has not accepted invitation. 
    * **Active**: User has accepted the invite and created an account.
    * **-**: The user was previously active but has not been active in the last 6 months.
    * **Deactivated**: Admin has revoked access of the user.
1. To see details about a user's last activity, hover your mouse over the **Last Active** field for the user.  A tooltip appears that shows when the user was added and how many total days the user has been active.

    A user is _active_ if they:
    - log in to W&B.
    - view any page in the W&B App.
    - log runs.
    - use the SDK to track an experiment.
    - interact with the W&B Server in any way.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Multi-tenant Cloud">
1. Navigate to the [**Members** page](https://wandb.ai/account-settings/wandb/members/). This page lists all users, along with data about each user.
1. To sort the list by user status, click the **Last Active** column label. Each user's status is one of the following:

    * **Invite pending**: Admin has sent invite but user has not accepted invitation. 
    * **Active**: User has accepted the invite and created an account.
    * `-`: A hyphen indicates that the user has not yet been active within the organization.

    A user is _active_ if they perform any auditable action scoped to the organization _after May 8, 2025_. For a full list, refer to [Actions](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/audit-logging#actions) in the Audit Logging page.

## Export user details

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dedicated or Self-managed">
From the **Users** tab, you can export details about how your organization uses W&B in CSV format.

1. Click the action `...` menu next to the **Invite new user user** button.
1. Click **Export as CSV**. The downloaded CSV file lists details about each user of an organization, such as their user name and email address, the time they were last active, their roles, and more.

For a full list, refer to [Actions](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/audit-logging#actions) in the Audit Logging page.
  - The **Weekly active users** plot shows the number of users active per week.

This page shows how to move a run from one project to another, into or out of a team, or from one team to another. You must have access to the run at its current and new locations.

<Note>
When you move a run, historical artifacts associated with it are not moved. To move an artifact manually, you can use the [`wandb artifact get`](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-get/) SDK command or the [`Api.artifact` API](/ref/python/public-api/api/#artifact) to download the artifact, then use [`wandb artifact put`](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-put/) or the `Api.artifact` API to upload it to the run's new location.
</Note>

To customize the **Runs** tab, refer to [Project page](/guides/models/track/project-page.md#runs-tab).

If you group runs into experiments, refer to [Set a group in the UI](grouping.md#set-a-group-in-the-ui).

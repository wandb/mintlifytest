Create alerts with Slack or email if your run crashes or with a custom trigger. For example, you can create an alert if the gradient of your training loop starts to blow up (reports NaN) or a step in your ML pipeline completes. Alerts apply to all projects where you initialize runs, including both personal and team projects.


And then see W&B Alerts messages in Slack (or your email):

<Note>
W&B Alerts require you to add `run.alert()` to your code. Without modifying your code, [Automations](/guides/core/automations/) provide another way to notify Slack based on an event in W&B, such as when an [artifact](/guides/core/artifacts) artifact version is created or when a [run metric](/guides/models/track/runs) meets or changes by a threshold.

For example, an automation can notify a Slack channel when a new version is created, run an automated testing webhook when the `production` alias is added to an artifact, or start a validation job only when a run's `loss` is within acceptable bounds.

Read the [Automations overview](/guides/core/automations/) or [create an automation](/guides/core/automations/create-automations/).

## Create an alert

<Note>
The following guide only applies to alerts in multi-tenant cloud.

If you're using [W&B Server](/guides/hosting/) in your Private Cloud or on W&B Dedicated Cloud, refer to [Configure Slack alerts in W&B Server](/guides/hosting/monitoring-usage/slack-alerts) to set up Slack alerts.
</Note>

To set up an alert, take these steps, which are detailed in the following sections:

1. Turn on Alerts in your W&B [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings).
2. Add `run.alert()` to your code.
3. Test the configuration.

### 1. Turn on alerts in your W&B User Settings

In your [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings):

* Scroll to the **Alerts** section
* Turn on **Scriptable run alerts** to receive alerts from `run.alert()`
* Use **Connect Slack** to pick a Slack channel to post alerts. We recommend the **Slackbot** channel because it keeps the alerts private.
* **Email** will go to the email address you used when you signed up for W&B. We recommend setting up a filter in your email so all these alerts go into a folder and don't fill up your inbox.

You will only have to do this the first time you set up W&B Alerts, or when you'd like to modify how you receive alerts.

### 2. Add `run.alert()` to your code

Add `run.alert()` to your code (either in a Notebook or Python script) wherever you'd like it to be triggered

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
run.alert(title="High Loss", text="Loss is increasing rapidly")
```

### 3. Test the configuration

Check your Slack or emails for the alert message. If you didn't receive any, make sure you've got emails or Slack turned on for **Scriptable Alerts** in your [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings)

## Example

This simple alert sends a warning when accuracy falls below a threshold. In this example, it only sends alerts at least 5 minutes apart.

```python
import wandb
from wandb import AlertLevel

run = wandb.init()

if acc < threshold:
    run.alert(
        title="Low accuracy",
        text=f"Accuracy {acc} is below the acceptable threshold {threshold}",
        level=AlertLevel.WARN,
        wait_duration=300,
    )
```


## Tag or mention users

Use the at sign `@` followed by the Slack user ID to tag yourself or your colleagues in either the title or the text of the alert. You can find a Slack user ID from their Slack profile page.

```python
run.alert(title="Loss is NaN", text=f"Hey <@U1234ABCD> loss has gone to NaN")
```

## Configure team alerts

Team admins can set up alerts for the team on the team settings page: `wandb.ai/teams/your-team`. 

Team alerts apply to everyone on your team. W&B recommends using the **Slackbot** channel because it keeps alerts private.

## Change Slack channel to send alerts to

To change what channel alerts are sent to, click **Disconnect Slack** and then reconnect. After you reconnect, pick a different Slack channel.

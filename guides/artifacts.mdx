Use W&B Artifacts to track and version data as the inputs and outputs of your [W&B Runs](/guides/runs/). For example, a model training run might take in a dataset as input and produce a trained model as output. You can log hyperparameters, metadata, and metrics to a run, and you can use an artifact to log, track, and version the dataset used to train the model as input and another artifact for the resulting model checkpoints as output.

## Use cases
You can use artifacts throughout your entire ML workflow as inputs and outputs of [runs](/guides/runs/). You can use datasets, models, or even other artifacts as inputs for processing.

<Note>
The proceeding code snippets are meant to be run in order.

## Create an artifact

Create an artifact with four lines of code:
1. Create a [W&B run](/guides/runs/).
2. Create an artifact object with the [`wandb.Artifact`](/ref/python/experiments/artifact) API.
3. Add one or more files, such as a model file or dataset, to your artifact object.
4. Log your artifact to W&B.

For example, the proceeding code snippet shows how to log a file called `dataset.h5` to an artifact called `example_artifact`:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(project="artifacts-example", job_type="add-dataset")
artifact = wandb.Artifact(name="example_artifact", type="dataset")
artifact.add_file(local_path="./dataset.h5", name="training_dataset")
artifact.save()

# Logs the artifact version "my_data" as a dataset with data from dataset.h5
```

- The `type` of the artifact affects how it appears in the W&B platform. If you do not specify a `type`, it defaults to `unspecified`.
- Each label of the dropdown represents a different `type` parameter value. In the above code snippet, the artifact's `type` is `dataset`.

<Note>
See the [track external files](/guides/artifacts/track-external-files/) page for information on how to add references to files or directories stored in external object storage, like an Amazon S3 bucket.
</Note>

## Download an artifact
Indicate the artifact you want to mark as input to your run with the [`use_artifact`](/ref/python/experiments/run.md#use_artifact) method.

Following the preceding code snippet, this next code block shows how to use the `training_dataset` artifact: 

```python
artifact = run.use_artifact(
    "training_dataset:latest"
)  # returns a run object using the "my_data" artifact
```
This returns an artifact object.

Next, use the returned object to download all contents of the artifact:

```python
datadir = (
    artifact.download()
)  # downloads the full `my_data` artifact to the default directory.
```

<Note>
You can pass a custom path into the `root` [parameter](/ref/python/experiments/artifact) to download an artifact to a specific directory. For alternate ways to download artifacts and to see additional parameters, see the guide on [downloading and using artifacts](/guides/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact/).

This page describes _automations_ in W&B. [Create an automation](create-automations/) to trigger workflow steps, such as automated model testing and deployment, based on an event in W&B, such as when an [artifact](/guides/core/artifacts) artifact version is created or when a [run metric](/guides/models/track/runs) meets or changes by a threshold.

For example, an automation can notify a Slack channel when a new version is created, trigger an automated testing webhook when the `production` alias is added to an artifact, or start a validation job only when a run's `loss` is within acceptable bounds.

## Overview
An automation can start when a specific [event](automation-events) occurs in a registry or project.

In a [Registry](/guides/core/registry/), an automation can start:
- When a new artifact version is linked to a collection. For example, trigger testing and validation workflows for new candidate models.
- When an alias is added to an artifact version. For example, trigger a deployment workflow when an alias is added to a model version.

In a [project](/guides/models/track/project-page), an automation can start:
- When a new version is added to an artifact. For example, start a training job when a new version of a dataset artifact is added to a given collection.
- When an alias is added to an artifact version. For example, trigger a PII redaction workflow when the alias "redaction" is added to a dataset artifact.
- When a tag is added to an artifact version. For example, trigger a geo-specific workflow when the tag "europe" is added to an artifact version.
- When a metric for a run meets or exceeds a configured threshold.
- When a metric for a run changes by a configured threshold.
- When a run's status changes to **Running**, **Failed**, or **Finished**.

Optionally filter runs by user or run name.

For more details, see [Automation events and scopes](automation-events).

To [create an automation](create-automations/), you:

1. If required, configure [secrets](/guides/core/secrets) for sensitive strings the automation requires, such as access tokens, passwords, or sensitive configuration details. Secrets are defined in your **Team Settings**. Secrets are most commonly used in webhook automations to securely pass credentials or tokens to the webhook's external service without exposing it in plain text or hard-coding it in the webhook's payload.
1. Configure the webhook or Slack notification to authorize W&B to post to Slack or run the webhook on your behalf. A single automation action (webhook or Slack notification) can be used by multiple automations. These actions are defined in your **Team Settings**.
1. In the project or registry, create the automation:
    1. Define the [event](#automation-events) to watch for, such as when a new artifact version is added. 
    1. Define the action to take when the event occurs (posting to a Slack channel or running a webhook). For a webhook, specify a secret to use for the access token and/or a secret to send with the payload, if required.

## Limitations
[Run metric automations](automation-events.md#run-metrics-events) are currently supported only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/guides/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).

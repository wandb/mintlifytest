You are working on enabling Vale tests to improve technical documentation quality. Your task is to systematically fix Vale violations while maintaining technical accuracy and following established style guidelines.

**Current Task**: Fix violations for the Vale test: ${VALE_TEST_NAME}

**Analysis Results**:
- Total violations across all files: ${TOTAL_VIOLATIONS}
- Files affected: ${TOTAL_FILES}
- High-impact file to fix first: ${HIGH_IMPACT_FILE} (${HIGH_IMPACT_COUNT} violations)

**Phase 1 Instructions - Fix High-Impact File Only**:

1. **Review Violations**: Examine the detailed violation analysis in `vale_analysis/high_impact_violations.txt` to understand specific issues

2. **Fix All Violations**: Address every ${VALE_TEST_NAME} violation in `${HIGH_IMPACT_FILE}` following these guidelines:
   - Read the file content to understand context
   - Apply appropriate fixes based on the specific Vale test
   - Maintain all technical details and accuracy
   - Use the edit_file or search_replace tools to make changes
   - Follow the technical writing style from CLAUDE.md

3. **Test Changes**: After fixing, verify success by running:
   ```bash
   vale --filter='.Name == "${VALE_TEST_NAME}"' ${HIGH_IMPACT_FILE}
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**: Create a clear, descriptive commit message documenting the fixes

**Important Constraints**:
- ONLY fix the high-impact file `${HIGH_IMPACT_FILE}` in this phase
- Do NOT fix other files yet - wait for approval after this phase
- Focus on quality over speed - each fix should be thoughtful and accurate

**Common Vale Test Fix Patterns**:

**Google.We Test** (First-person plural pronouns):
- "We" → "You" (when addressing reader)
- "We" → "This tutorial/guide/example" (when describing content)
- "our" → "your" or "the" 
- "us" → "you"
- "we'll" → "you'll" or "this tutorial will"
- "we're" → "you're"

**write-good.Cliches Test** (Overused phrases):
- Replace clichéd expressions with specific, direct language
- "at the end of the day" → "ultimately" or "finally"
- "low hanging fruit" → "easy opportunities"
- "game changer" → "significant improvement"

**Google.Passive Test** (Passive voice):
- Convert passive constructions to active voice
- "The file is created by the system" → "The system creates the file"
- "Data is processed" → "The application processes data"

**Style Guidelines**:
- Use second person ("you") for instructions and user actions
- Use active voice and present tense
- Keep technical terminology intact
- Maintain code examples and technical specifications exactly
- Preserve all links, references, and formatting
- Follow Google Developer Documentation Style Guide principles
- Ensure readability while preserving technical depth

**Quality Checks**:
- Verify no technical information is lost
- Ensure all code examples remain functional
- Check that links and references are preserved
- Confirm the tone remains professional and helpful
- Validate that instructions are still clear and actionable

After completing the fixes and committing your work, provide a summary of:
- Number of violations fixed
- Types of changes made
- Any challenges encountered
- Confirmation that technical accuracy is preserved

Wait for approval before proceeding to fix remaining files in other documents.

Add a description to the model card of your registered model to document aspects of your machine learning model. Some topics worth documenting include:

* **Summary**: A summary of what the model is. The purpose of the model. The machine learning framework the model uses, and so forth. 
* **Training data**: Describe the training data used, processing done on the training data set, where is that data stored and so forth.
* **Architecture**: Information about the model architecture, layers, and any specific design choices.
* **Deserialize the model**: Provide information on how someone on your team can load the model into memory.
* **Task**: The specific type of task or problem that the machine learning model is designed to perform. It's a categorization of the model's intended capability.
* **License**: The legal terms and permissions associated with the use of the machine learning model. It helps model users understand the legal framework under which they can utilize the model.
* **References**: Citations or references to relevant research papers, datasets, or external resources.
* **Deployment**: Details on how and where the model is deployed and guidance on how the model is integrated into other enterprise systems, such as a workflow orchestration platforms.

## Add a description to the model card

1. Navigate to the [W&B Model Registry app](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Select **View details** next to the name of the registered model you want to create a model card for.
2. Go to the **Model card** section.

3. Within the **Description** field, provide information about your machine learning model. Format text within a model card with [Markdown markup language](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

For example, the following images shows the model card of a **Credit-card Default Prediction** registered model.

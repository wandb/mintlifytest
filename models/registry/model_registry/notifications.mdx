2. Select the registered model you want to receive notifications from.
3. Click on the **Connect Slack** button.

    </Frame>
4. Follow the instructions to enable W&B in your Slack workspace that appear on the OAuth page.


Once you have configured Slack notifications for your team, you can pick and choose registered models to get notifications from. 

<Note>
A toggle that reads **New model version linked to...** appears instead of a **Connect Slack** button if you have Slack notifications configured for your team.
</Note>

The screenshot below shows a FMNIST classifier registered model that has Slack notifications.

A message is automatically posted to the connected Slack channel each time a new model version is linked to the FMNIST classifier registered model.

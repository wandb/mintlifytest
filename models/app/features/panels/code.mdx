By default, W&B only saves the latest git commit hash. You can turn on more code features to compare the code between your experiments dynamically in the UI.

Starting with `wandb` version 0.8.28, W&B can save the code from your main training file where you call `wandb.init()`. 

## Save library code

When you enable code saving, W&B saves the code from the file that called `wandb.init()`. To save additional library code, you have three options:

### Call `wandb.Run.log_code(".")` after calling `wandb.init()`

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log_code(".")
```

### Pass a settings object to `wandb.init()` with `code_dir` set

```python
import wandb

wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(code_dir="."))
```

This captures all python source code files in the current directory and all subdirectories as an [artifact](/ref/python/experiments/artifact). For more control over the types and locations of source code files that are saved, see the [reference docs](/ref/python/experiments/run#log_code).

### Set code saving in the UI

In addition to setting code saving programmatically, you can also toggle this feature in your W&B account Settings. Note that this will enable code saving for all teams associated with your account.

> By default, W&B disables code saving for all teams.

1. Log in to your W&B account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**.
3. Under **Project and content security**, toggle **Disable default code saving** on. 

## Code comparer
Compare code used in different W&B runs:

1. Select the **Add panels** button in the top right corner of the page.
2. Expand **TEXT AND CODE** dropdown and select **Code**.

## Jupyter session history

W&B saves the history of code executed in your Jupyter notebook session. When you call **wandb.init()** inside of Jupyter, W&B adds a hook to automatically save a Jupyter notebook containing the history of code executed in your current session. 


1. Navigate to your project workspaces that contains your code.
2. Select the **Artifacts** tab in the left navigation bar.
3. Expand the **code** artifact.
4. Select the **Files** tab.

This displays the cells that were run in your session along with any outputs created by calling iPythonâ€™s display method. This enables you to see exactly what code was run within Jupyter in a given run. When possible W&B also saves the most recent version of the notebook which you would find in the code directory as well.

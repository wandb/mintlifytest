### <kbd>function</kbd> `finish`

```python
finish(exit_code: 'int | None' = None, quiet: 'bool | None' = None) â†’ None
```

Finish a run and upload any remaining data. 

Marks the completion of a W&B run and ensures all data is synced to the server. The run's final state is determined by its exit conditions and sync status. 

Run States: 
- Running: Active run that is logging data and/or sending heartbeats. 
- Crashed: Run that stopped sending heartbeats unexpectedly. 
- Finished: Run completed successfully (`exit_code=0`) with all data synced. 
- Failed: Run completed with errors (`exit_code!=0`). 



**Args:**
 
 - `exit_code`:  Integer indicating the run's exit status. Use 0 for success,  any other value marks the run as failed. 
 - `quiet`:  Deprecated. Configure logging verbosity using `wandb.Settings(quiet=...)`.

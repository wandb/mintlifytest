Parallelize your W&B Sweep agents on a multi-core or multi-GPU machine. Before you get started, ensure you have initialized your W&B Sweep. For more information on how to initialize a W&B Sweep, see [Initialize sweeps](./initialize-sweeps).

### Parallelize on a multi-CPU machine

Depending on your use case, explore the proceeding tabs to learn how to parallelize W&B Sweep agents using the CLI or within a Jupyter Notebook.


<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
Use the [`wandb agent`](/ref/cli/wandb-agent) command to parallelize your sweep agent across multiple CPUs with the terminal. Provide the sweep ID that was returned when you [initialized the sweep](./initialize-sweeps). 

1. Open more than one terminal window on your local machine.
2. Copy and paste the code snippet below and replace `sweep_id` with your sweep ID:

```bash
wandb agent sweep_id
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Jupyter Notebook">
Use the W&B Python SDK library to parallelize your W&B Sweep agent across multiple CPUs within Jupyter Notebooks. Ensure you have the sweep ID that was returned when you [initialized the sweep](./initialize-sweeps).  In addition, provide the name of the function the sweep will execute for the `function` parameter:

1. Open more than one Jupyter Notebook.
2. Copy and past the W&B Sweep ID on multiple Jupyter Notebooks to parallelize a W&B Sweep. For example, you can paste the following code snippet on multiple jupyter notebooks to paralleliz your sweep if you have the sweep ID stored in a variable called `sweep_id` and the name of the function is `function_name`: 

```python
wandb.agent(sweep_id=sweep_id, function=function_name)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>



### Parallelize on a multi-GPU machine

Follow the procedure outlined to parallelize your W&B Sweep agent across multiple GPUs with a terminal using CUDA Toolkit:

1. Open more than one terminal window on your local machine.
2. Specify the GPU instance to use with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` when you start a W&B Sweep job ([`wandb agent`](/ref/cli/wandb-agent)). Assign `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` an integer value corresponding to the GPU instance to use.

For example, suppose you have two NVIDIA GPUs on your local machine. Open a terminal window and set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to `0` (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`). Replace `sweep_ID` in the proceeding example with the W&B Sweep ID that is returned when you initialized a W&B Sweep:

Terminal 1

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 wandb agent sweep_ID
```

Open a second terminal window. Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to `1` (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`). Paste the same W&B Sweep ID for the `sweep_ID` mentioned in the proceeding code snippet:

Terminal 2

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 wandb agent sweep_ID
```

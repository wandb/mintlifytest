title: How do I fix Invalid Authentication (401) errors with W&B Inference?
---

A 401 Invalid Authentication error means your API key is invalid or your W&B project entity/name is incorrect.

## Verify your API key

1. Get a new API key at [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)
2. Check for extra spaces or missing characters when copying
3. Store your API key securely

## Check your project configuration

Ensure your project is formatted correctly as `<your-team>/<your-project>`:

**Python example:**
```python
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1',
    api_key="<your-api-key>",
    project="<your-team>/<your-project>",  # Must match your W&B team and project
)
```

**Bash example:**
```bash
curl https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: <your-team>/<your-project>"
```

## Common mistakes

- Using personal entity instead of team name
- Misspelling team or project name
- Missing forward slash between team and project
- Using an expired or deleted API key

## Still having issues?

- Verify the team and project exist in your W&B account
- Ensure you have access to the specified team
- Try creating a new API key if the current one isn't working

title: What if I want to integrate W&B into my project, but I don't want to upload
  any images or media?

W&B supports projects that log only scalars by allowing explicit specification of files or data for upload. Refer to this [example in PyTorch](https://wandb.me/pytorch-colab) that demonstrates logging without using images.

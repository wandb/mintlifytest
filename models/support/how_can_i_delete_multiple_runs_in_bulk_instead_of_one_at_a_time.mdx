title: How can I delete multiple runs in bulk instead of one at a time?
---

Use the [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api) to delete multiple runs in a single operation:

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs('<entity>/<project>')
for run in runs:
    if <condition>:
        run.delete()
```

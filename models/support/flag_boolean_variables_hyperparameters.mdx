title: Can we flag boolean variables as hyperparameters?
---

Use the `${args_no_boolean_flags}` macro in the command section of the configuration to pass hyperparameters as boolean flags. This macro automatically includes boolean parameters as flags. If `param` is `True`, the command receives `--param`. If `param` is `False`, the flag is omitted.

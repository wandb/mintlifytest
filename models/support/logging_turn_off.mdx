title: How do I turn off logging?
---

The command `wandb offline` sets the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline`, preventing data from syncing to the remote W&B server. This action affects all projects, stopping the logging of data to W&B servers.

To suppress warning messages, use the following code:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

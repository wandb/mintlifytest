title: What happens if I pass a class attribute into wandb.Run.log()?
---

Avoid passing class attributes into `wandb.Run.log()`. Attributes may change before the network call executes. When storing metrics as class attributes, use a deep copy to ensure the logged metric matches the attribute's value at the time of the `wandb.Run.log()` call.

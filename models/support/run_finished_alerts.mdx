title: Do "Run Finished" alerts work in notebooks?
---

No. **Run Finished** alerts (activated with the **Run Finished** setting in User Settings) operate only with Python scripts and remain turned off in Jupyter Notebook environments to avoid notifications for each cell execution. 

Use `run.alert()` in notebook environments instead.

title: Is there a way to add extra values to a sweep, or do I need to start a new
  one?

Once a W&B Sweep starts, you cannot change the Sweep configuration. However, you can navigate to any table view, select runs using the checkboxes, and then choose the **Create sweep** menu option to generate a new Sweep configuration based on previous runs.

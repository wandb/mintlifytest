title: Who has access to my artifacts?
---

Artifacts inherit access permissions from their parent project:

* In a private project, only team members can access artifacts.
* In a public project, all users can read artifacts, while only team members can create or modify them.
* In an open project, all users can read and write artifacts.

## Artifacts Workflows

This section outlines workflows for managing and editing Artifacts. Many workflows utilize [the W&B API](/guides/track/public-api-guide/), a component of [the client library](/ref/python/) that provides access to W&B-stored data.

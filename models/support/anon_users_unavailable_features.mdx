* **No artifact logging**: A warning appears on the command line when attempting to log an artifact to an anonymous run:
    ```bash
    wandb: WARNING Artifacts logged anonymously cannot be claimed and expire after 7 days.
    ```

* **No profile or settings pages**: The UI does not include certain pages, as they are only useful for real accounts.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of launching multinode training jobs with W&B and Volcano on Kubernetes.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use W&B Launch to run multinode jobs on Kubernetes. The steps we will follow are:

- Ensure that you have a W&B account and a Kubernetes cluster.
- Create a launch queue for our volcano jobs.
- Deploy a Launch agent into our kubernetes cluster.
- Create a distributed training job.
- Launch our distributed training.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need:

- A W&B account
- A Kubernetes cluster

## Create a launch queue

The first step is to create a launch queue. Head to [wandb.ai/launch](https://wandb.ai/launch) and in the top right corner of your screen, hit the blue **Create a queue** button. A queue creation drawer will slide out from the right side of your screen. Select an entity, enter a name, and select **Kubernetes** as the type for your queue.

In the configuration section, we will enter a [volcano job](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/vcjob/) template. Any runs launched from this queue will be created using this job specification, so you can modify this configuration as needed to customize your jobs.

This configuration block can accept a Kubernetes job specification, volcano job specification, or any other custom resource definition (CRD) that you are interested in launching. You can make use of [macros in the configuration block](/launch/set-up-launch/) to dynamically set the contents of this spec.


In this tutorial, we will use a configuration for multinode pytorch training that makes use of [volcano's pytorch plugin](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/blob/master/docs/user-guide/how_to_use_pytorch_plugin.md). You can copy and paste the following config as YAML or JSON:

Click the **Create queue** button at the bottom of the drawer to finish creating your queue.

## Install Volcano

To install Volcano in your Kubernetes cluster, you can follow the [official installation guide](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/installation/).

## Deploy your launch agent

Now that you have created a queue, you will need to deploy a launch agent to pull and execute jobs from the queue. The easiest way to do this is with the [`launch-agent` chart from W&B's official `helm-charts` repository](https://github.com/wandb/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/launch-agent). Follow the instructions in the README to install the chart into your Kubernetes cluster, and be sure to configure the agent to poll the queue you created earlier.

## Create a training job

Volcano's pytorch plugin automatically configures the necessary environment variables for pytorch DPP to work, such as `MASTER_ADDR`, `RANK`, and `WORLD_SIZE`, as long as your pytorch code uses DDP correctly. Refer to [pytorch's documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) for more details on how to use DDP in your custom python code.

<Note>
Volcano's pytorch plugin is also compatible with [multinode training via the PyTorch Lightning `Trainer`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#num-nodes).
</Note>

## Launch

Now that our queue and cluster are set up, it's time to launch some distributed training. To start off with we will use [a job](https://wandb.ai/wandb/multinodetest/jobs/QXJ0aWZhY3RDb2xsZWN0aW9uOjc3MDcwNTg1/runs/latest) trains a simple multi-layer perceptron on random data using volcano's pytorch plugin. You can find the source code for the job [here](https://github.com/wandb/launch-jobs/tree/main/jobs/distributed_test).

To launch this job, head to the [job's page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/multinodetest/jobs/QXJ0aWZhY3RDb2xsZWN0aW9uOjc3MDcwNTg1/runs/latest) and click the **Launch** button in the top right corner of the screen. You will be prompted to select a queue to launch the job from.

1. Set the jobs parameters however you like,
2. Select the queue you created earlier.
3. Modify the volcano job in the **Resource config** section to modify the parameters of your job. For example, you can change the number of workers by changing the `replicas` field in the `worker` task.
4. Click **Launch**.

You can monitor the progress and if necessary stop your job from the W&B UI.
